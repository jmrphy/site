So we analyzed the diversity of tech journalists. Using multiple sampling methods, and multiple ways of measuring race and gender, we find that tech journalism is almost certainly less racially diverse than tech itself.\nTLDR The workforce of the big five tech companies is about 51% white, averaging across each company’s most recent diversity report, linked below. Big Tech is therefore more diverse than tech journalism, which our analysis suggests to be somewhere between 77% on the low end (if we infer race from surnames of 855 Twitter accounts) and 84% white on the high end (if we check our results against third-party-curated Twitter lists of tech journalists). If we guess race from a manual, subjective assessment of the 855 Twitter accounts we identified, then it appears that 80% of tech journalists are white. The tightness of these estimates for tech journalism should inspire some confidence in their accuracy.\nAs of 2020, the percentage of White employees at Facebook is 63.2%. At Google, 51.7%. At Microsoft, 53.2%. At Amazon, 34.7%. At Apple, 50%.\nHere is our dataset.\n Background and overview of the methodology The initial dataset gathered by OoTheNigerian focused on the diversity of attendees at tech-journalism conferences, but this approach has two major limitations. First, conferences are subject to a variety of selection biases, which might not have anything to do with tech-journalism culture per se. Second, there are only so many tech-journalism conferences, so this approach will likely leave us with an unnecessarily small sample.\nHere we pursue a different approach, using multiple methods to check the robustness of our results. Thanks to OoTheNigerian for his help.\n Two different sampling methods We use two different sampling methods to make sure our results are not sensitive to how the set of “tech journalists” is defined. In a first sampling method, we collected lists of individuals on Twitter whose bios indicate current or past work for any one of 13 major tech-journalism outlets (namely Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard).\nAlternatively, we also gather a dataset of tech journalists by combining two publicly available, third-party-curated lists called “Tech Journalists.” We had no role in the curation of these lists, so if the results of our diversity analysis are similar when conducted on this sample as well, we should be highly confident that our analyses accurately reflect the true state of tech journalism on Twitter.\n Two ways of estimating race and gender Estimating race and gender is fraught. A method based on measurable, objective aspects of a person’s identity may fail to capture certain nuances in how race and gender are socially constructed. A method based on subjective human judgment might err by being inconsistent, ignorant, or prejudiced about how race and gender are assigned. To deal with the limitations of each method, we estimate race and gender through both methods: If the results are similar, we should be relatively confident in their accuracy.\nSubjective judgment. Estimating race and gender through subjective judgment was straightforward, if not always possible: We looked at each Twitter account and inferred the individual’s race and gender holistically, using their profile photo, name, and context-clues in their bio. In most cases, the inference was unambiguous. In cases where either the gender or race was unclear, we assigned an “NA” for the given variable. Given some controversy over the race of Arab and Persian people (the US census says “white” but many people have contested this), we sidestep the matter by assigning Arabs and Persians “NA” for race. (There were only about 15 total so including them would likely make tech journalism even less diverse.)\nObjective judgment. Alternatively, we leveraged data from the Census and the Social Security Administration to infer journalist’s race and gender from surnames and first names, respectively.\n Note on the analytic virtue of using Twitter data While our approach certainly has its own limitations, analyzing the culture of tech journalism via Twitter-based samples seems uniquely attractive. First, it’s possible some tech journalists are not on Twitter, but since Twitter is both a hot technology and a watering-hole for journalists, this potential selection bias seems particularly unthreatening. Twitter is arguably the ideal place to draw a sample of tech journalists. A second limitation of my approach is that we may very well fail to identify some tech journalists who are on Twitter, but this is only an analytical problem if there is some reason to believe that white people or male people are more or less likely to surface in my search procedures. Assuming this is very unlikely, the worst that can be said of our sampling method is that it’s unlikely to capture every single tech journalist on Twitter. Nonetheless, it is likely to be quite close to a random sample of all the tech journalists on Twitter, which means it should plausibly generalize. If there is a non-trivial community of tech journalists not on Twitter someone should tell them about what’s new in the world of technology.\n Note on inferring race and gender from names In estimating race from surnames, the most serious problem is due to the history of anti-black racism and slavery in the United States. Because of slavery in the United States, black people in America today frequently have non-African last names (such as Williams or Washington). Therefore, inferring race from surnames will generally under-count black people. As you’ll see below, we take some extra steps to mitigate this problem (see my comments inside the code snippets), but the results of any automated measurement method will always have some amount of error. Same for gender. We believe this problem is more than off-set by using subjective judgment as an independent and alternative approach.\n Approach 1: Tech journalists who mention a major tech-journalism outlet in their bio I used the R package rtweet to search for anyone on Twitter who mentions one of 12 journalism-related keywords (reporter, journalist, producer, designer, editor, writer, analyst, current, former, bylines, columnist, freelance) and one of 13 tech-journalism oulets in their bio (Verge, Gigaom, Cnet, Wired, Engadget, The Information, Recode, The Next Web, Venture Beat, TechRadar, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, and Motherboard). The API allows for up to 1,000 results per search.\n# Load required packages require(rtweet) require(tidyverse) require(predictrace) require(stringr) require(gender) require(DT) require(grid) # Search for accounts mentioning tech-journalism outlets v1 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;reporter Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v2 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;journalist Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v3 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;producer Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v4 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;designer Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v5 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;editor Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v6 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;writer Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v7 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;analyst Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v8 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;current Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v9 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;former Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v10 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;bylines Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v11 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;columnist Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v12 \u0026lt;- search_users(\u0026quot;freelance Verge\u0026quot;, n = 1000) v\u0026lt;-rbind(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10, v11, v12) v$outlet\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;The Verge\u0026quot;

I take these at face value and combine all the listed Twitter accounts into a new sample of tech journalists. Then I re-run all of the analyses above on this new sample. The initial number of journalists in Sample 2 is 424; after removing duplicates the number is 360.\nThe basic counts are: 179 likely to be White, 17 likely to be Asian, 9 likely to be Black, and 8 likely to be Hispanic. The rest could not be classified.\nThe result is very close to our previous results, again: 84% White.\n# Import the accounts identified by each list journo.list1\u0026lt;-lists_members(96162061) journo.list2\u0026lt;-lists_members(53301954) # Bind them into one dataframe df2\u0026lt;-rbind(journo.list1, journo.list2) # Extract surname and predict race df2$lastnames\u0026lt;-word(df2$name,-1) race.lists.df\u0026lt;-predict_race(df2$lastnames) # To partially mitigate the problem of under-identifying black people, # any surname with a probability of being black greater than .4 will # will be classified as black.

If you’re me, you might just ask them straight up. But often, there are reasons why you can’t be so forward.\nThankfully, political opinions are not randomly distributed. So if you can glean a few facts about someone, you can often predict their other, more hidden opinions. The challenge is knowing which pieces of small-talk are the most predictive of the jucier questions you can’t quite ask them.\nMaybe you only have one minute; which questions should you ask? In what order should you ask them? If there’s no time limit, how many questions should you ask before you’re wasting your time?\nThe ideal solution would be a short list of questions, in a particular order, like a tree: If they say yes to this, then ask them this, and so on. Ideally, this list would be as short and simple as necessary to make the best guess possible.\nIt turns out there is a statistical technique that matches this challenge perfectly. Recursive partitioning is a technique that produces decision trees of binary or “yes/no” questions. The resulting decision tree represents the statistically optimal path of questioning.\nHow to conduct recursive partitioning in R Let’s say you want to predict whether or not someone supports the suppression of racist speakers. A bit akward to ask straight up at a dinner party. We can use a large public dataset such as the General Social Survey, run some recursive partitioning, and obtain the “tree” of mundane questions we can respectably ask someone at a dinner party.\nFirst, identify the variable of interest. In the GSS, there is a variable that asks whether racist speakers should be allowed to speak or not. The name of the variable is spkrac. (In my processing, I renamed this variable spkrac.fac.) Then identify the variables representing mundane facts you can observe yourself or reasonably ask about within the norms of small talk. I identified the following mundane variables (for more information, search for the GSS codebook):\n sex/gender = variable named sex race = variable named race left/right identification = variable named pol family income = variable named realinc college attendance = variable named college word knowledge or verbal skill (proxy for IQ) = variable named wordsum   How to conduct recursive partitioning for a binary dependent variable in R In this case, our variable of interest is a binary variable: one either allows or disallows racist speakers. The modeling routines are different for different variables of interest, but so long as your variable of interest is binary, you can more or less follow the following routine. The code is commented.\nFirst we need to import the raw GSS data and process the variables we’ll be using.\n# Import the necessary packages require(tidyverse) require(haven) require(knitr) require(rpart) require(rpart.plot) gssFullPanel \u0026lt;- read_dta(\u0026quot;/Users/justin/Dropbox/Public/political-data/GSS7218_R1.dta\u0026quot;) df \u0026lt;- subset(gssFullPanel, select = c(sex, educ, realinc, polviews, spkrac, race, ethnic, wordsum)) # Race # Optional: Assign NA to other because it\u0026#39;s ambiguous and wildly unstable over time # factor() removes empty factor levels, which is useful here because IAP = 0 df$race\u0026lt;-factor(df$race) levels(df$race) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;White\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Black\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;) # levels(df$race)[levels(df$race)==\u0026#39;Other\u0026#39;] \u0026lt;- NA # Sex # as_factor() from haven package brings in the labels for factor levels df$sex\u0026lt;-as_factor(df$sex) levels(df$sex) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Male\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Female\u0026quot;) # College df$college \u0026lt;- ifelse(as.numeric(df$educ)\u0026lt;=12, \u0026quot;No College\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;At Least Some College\u0026quot;) df$college \u0026lt;- factor(df$college, levels=c(\u0026quot;No College\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;At Least Some College\u0026quot;)) df$spkrac.fac \u0026lt;- factor(df$spkrac -1) # Reduce to 0 and 1 and convert to factor levels(df$spkrac.fac)\u0026lt;-c(\u0026quot;Allowed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Not Allowed\u0026quot;) # Rename levels df$pol \u0026lt;- as_factor(df$polviews) df$pol \u0026lt;- dplyr::recode(df$pol, \u0026quot;EXTREMELY LIBERAL\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Extremely Liberal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;liberal\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Liberal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SLIGHTLY LIBERAL\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Slightly Liberal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;moderate\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Moderate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SLGHTLY CONSERVATIVE\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Slightly Conservative\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;conservative\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Conservative\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;EXTRMLY CONSERVATIVE\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;Extremely Conservative\u0026quot;, .default = NA_character_) Now we can conduct the partitioning.

The top of the tree is the first question you should ask, the single variable that gives you the most leverage to predict your victim’s secret opinion. The top node represents your knowledge before asking them anything: If you meet a random person, there is a 38% chance they would vote to suppress racist speakers. This applies to the whole population of America (100%.)\nAccording to the analysis, the first question with the most predictive power is: “Did you ever go to college?” If they say yes, the probability of them wanting to suppress drops to 29% and that’s all you need to ask them! Nothing else will improve your guess (at least from the variables we selected).\nIf they never went to college, the next question you have to ask yourself is whether they’re smart. You probably don’t want to give them a vocabulary test, but conversation is pretty naturally revealing. So if they are on the dumb side, consider them a “no” in this chart. If they are smart, then you infer with a 40% probablility that they would disallow the speaker (you infer that they would allow). If they are dumb, it’s now a coin flip (and 26% of the population is here).\nNext, what is their race? This you can probably guess yourself. From here:\n If they are white, then there’s a 48% chance they would disallow the speaker. If then they are male, there’s a 45% chance they would disallow and that’s your final guess (that they would allow). If they are female, you can see if their family is rich or not. If rich, they are slightly less likely than a coin flip to disallow the speaker (46%); if poor, they’re slightly more likely than a coin flip to disallow the speaker (54%).\n If they are dumb and non-white,then there’s a 57% chance they would not allow the speaker. And that’s your best guess.\n   Conclusion For a relatively small dataset, the results strike me as reasonably useful (and intuitively plausible). To gauge this, consider that a “yes” to our first question (whether they attended any college) gives us a pretty good bet that our interlocutor would allow racist speakers (71%), and that represents about 50% of people! With only a few more questions, two of which we can observe without asking, we can get to as much as a 57% guess that they would disallow.\nProbably the major limitation of this short study is that we don’t get very impressive traction on those who would disallow racist speakers. The highest we get is a 57% probability, which is non-trivially better than if we know nothing about someone (in which case we’d guess a 38% probability). But it’s still not great. All this means is that we need better predictor variables, which we could identify through additional research. But as a first cut with a small handful of variables I gathered based only on my own intuitions, these results are pretty good, I think.\nPerhaps the most interesting implication here is that ideological identification totally drops out! It appears that it’s not predictive. This is fascinating, given that many people today tend to think of speech suppression is a fashion on the educated Left! And it is, but that’s only a highly visible minority. Political scientists would not be surprised by this result: We’ve long known that leftists and educated people are always more supportive of free expression (you just don’t hear about those people in the media right now).\nThe next time you’re at a party, please try this.

As one part of this larger argument, I\u0026rsquo;ve long been curious about Kekistan, a mythical country the defining characteristic of which is that it is supposed to be outside of political correctness. Many leftist activists today assert that it\u0026rsquo;s a fascist country, but we know very well that the tendency to call others fascist has inflated dramatically in recent years. Many Kekistanis claim that they simply want the freedom to meme and \u0026ldquo;shitpost.\u0026rdquo; Much has been written about the notorious Kekistan, but very little systematic research has been conducted on the underlying distribution of beliefs and interests belonging to the Kekistani people. Here I provide what is, I believe, the first serious effort to systematically sample and analyze the \u0026ldquo;public opinion\u0026rdquo; of a mythical, virtual country. As far as I know, this will be the first serious attempt to understand the political ideology and attitudes of Kekistan.\nI also have a personal motivation to understand the true nature of Kekistan. A brief explanation of this motivation will both add some depth to the hypotheses I\u0026rsquo;ve been developing on this blog, and also give you some fair disclosure of this author\u0026rsquo;s possible biases. Back when I was still a respectable member of the organized left, the Kekistani migrations quite intrigued my own cyber-anarchist and free-speech-absolutist instincts\u0026ndash;enough that, at one point, I playfully set my Twitter location to \u0026ldquo;Kekistan.\u0026rdquo; That a card-carrying member of the public radical left might vacation in this controversial country, I thought, would only be a tiny but much-need signal that not everyone on the radical left is an uptight moralistic blowhard. A small service to the radical left\u0026rsquo;s engagement of the internet public, I thought. I did due diligence and researched the history of the meme, confirming to my satisfaction that — although it had certainly been used by some fascist types here and there — its origin was demonstrably not fascist or racist, and the overwhelming majority of its uptake could only be described as relatively vacuous cultural anarchism. So I was beyond surprised when my invocation of Kekistan would later be cited by a comrade as Exhibit 3.7 in the case for Justin to be disowned. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to cite the emails of former comrades here, as that would feel unncessarily aggressive, but the gist of the accusation was that Kekistan and its associated imagery was racist/fascist: it\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;alt-right,\u0026rdquo; which is the new face of fascism, in sneaky new clothing geared to make fascism more palatable to the general public. I responded with my theory that, on the contrary, Kekistan seemed mostly to do with free speech and a radical left willing to play on this terrain — admittedly dubious and dangerous, but not fascist in origin or on average — might open extremely valuable possibilities for leftist, emancipatory social change.\nMy former comrade\u0026rsquo;s intuition that Kekistan is simply \u0026ldquo;alt-right,\u0026rdquo; and therefore racist or fascist, is indeed the conventional wisdom. The Southern Poverty Law Center offers an explainer article, \u0026ldquo;What the Kek: Explaining the Alt-Right \u0026lsquo;Deity\u0026rsquo; Behind Their \u0026lsquo;Meme Magic\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, opening with the following summary statement in large font:\n A satirical religion with a frog-headed god has become a favorite new way for white nationalists to troll liberals, while spreading their meme-driven strategy.\n In Angela Nagle\u0026rsquo;s book about the online culture wars, Kill All Normies, Kek only appears in one section of the first chapter, as an avatar of the Right. Although Nagle accurately conveys its general cyber-anarchistic innocence and ambiguity, she nonetheless defaults to seeing it as \u0026ldquo;alt-right:\u0026rdquo;\n “A common reference on the alt-right ‘kek’ started on 4chan and translated to ‘lol’ in comment boards on the multiplayer videogame World of Warcraft, while Pepe the Frog, originating in Matt Furie’s Web comic Boy’s Club, epitomizes online in-joke meme humor. Kek is also an ancient Egyptian deity represented as a frog-headed man while ‘the Church of Kek’ and ‘praise Kek’ refer to their ironic religion. One of the things that linked the often nihilistic and ironic chan culture to a wider culture of the alt-right orbit was their opposition to political correctness, feminism, multiculturalism, etc., and its encroachment into their freewheeling world of anonymity and tech.”\n In this common view above, a non-right-wing ideological dimension (\u0026ldquo;nihilistic chan culture\u0026rdquo;) is mixing with right-wing ideological dimensions (the \u0026ldquo;alt right\u0026rdquo;) because of their shared opposition to left-wing dimensions (political correctness, feminism, multiculturalism). In this way of describing it, \u0026ldquo;opposition to political correctness\u0026rdquo; gets defined as a dimension of the alt-right, not by any empirical demonstration but by presumption:\n \u0026hellip;it was really the broadest orbit of the alt-right, which became known as the alt-light, that popularized this new diffuse and chaotic online set of cross-pollinating subcultures and helped bring it into the mainstream. These included\u0026hellip; a host of Pepe meme-making gamers and 4chan-style shitposters, who had little in the way of a coherent commitment to conservative thought or politics but shared an anti-PC impulse and a common aesthetic sensibility. What we now call the alt-right is really this collection of lots of separate tendencies that grew semi-independently but which were joined under the banner of a bursting forth of anti-PC cultural politics through the culture wars of recent years.\n Nagle\u0026rsquo;s account is reasonably balanced, the key point is only to see that she defaults to the presumption that \u0026ldquo;nihilistic\u0026rdquo; free speech politics shares some kind of affinity with right-wing tendencies (the alt-right \u0026ldquo;orbit\u0026rdquo;), when in fact there is a very plausible alternative hypothesis. An equally plausible way of describing the same phenomena is that the free speech political priorities of chan culture actually include a left-libertarian dilution of the right-wing tendencies of some of their free-speech bedfellows; in this view, the online free speech issue would be the primary issue, to which many people are attracted from the right and left (and off the spectrum); this vector militates against the Authoritarian Left of political correctness and the Authoritarian Right of white nationalism. In this view, the \u0026ldquo;alt-right\u0026rdquo; is incorrectly named with devastating implications, for in this view the \u0026ldquo;alt-right\u0026rdquo; is not so much a \u0026ldquo;cross-pollinating\u0026rdquo; of nihilists and right-wingers in a vague orbit of right-wing flavour; this clunky term is trying but failing to label a new, uniquely digital, multi-dimensional escape vector (by left-leaners and right-leaners) from all of the oppressive strictures of today\u0026rsquo;s dominant, bourgoeis institutions as such.\nOf course, if the composition of Kekistan leans heavily to the right, this would be unsurprising given that — and this is crucial — the number of leftists available for anti-institutional offshoots such as Kekistan is suppressed below its true rate by fiat from those institutions, as my personal case reveals (e.g., if all of your cultural and economic preferences are clearly Left and you want to join Kekistan because you care more about free speech than anything else, you simply get removed from the official count of who is on the Left.) If we find any evidence of non-right-wing energies circulating in Kekistan, it is almost certainly but the tip of an iceberg.\nData and Method I begin by identifying users who posted status updates containing any one of the following search queries: \u0026ldquo;#Kek,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Kekistan,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;PraiseKek.\u0026rdquo; Twitter\u0026rsquo;s Rest API only goes back 6-9 days, so obviously this approach gives a time-restricted sample. To supplement this, I also used a script to scrape tweets (and user information) from Twitter Advanced Search. Advanced Search goes back farther, but this method does not seem to give full coverage, either. Combining these methods gave me a total of 13,467 status updates containing at least one of the above terms, published by 5,249 unique users.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a solidly sized sample, but informal inspection shows a non-trivial number of false positives (updates clearly not about Kekistan or not from pro-Kek accounts). To deal with this, I also explore a reduced sample that errs on the side of being smaller but more strictly pro-Kekistani. Specifically, the narrow sample (which I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to as Kekistani Activists) contains only users who describe themselves with one of the following, unambiguously pro-Kek phrases: \u0026ldquo;Praise Kek\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Kekistani, or \u0026ldquo;Free Kekistan.\u0026rdquo;\nAdditionally, I scraped up to 2,000 status updates from the user feeds of these individuals who at least once tweeted with the above phrases (#Kek, Kekistan, or PraiseKek). After subtracting for accounts that could not be scraped, accounts that had a small number of tweets, removing duplicates such as retweeted tweets, etc., this produced a sample of about 2.6 million tweets. These tweets are mostly unrelated to Kekistan, but they give us a large sample of textual data about the interests and beliefs of the individuals who have at least once visited Kekistan.\nBefore analysis, I conducted a standard set of pre-processing tasks helpful for this kind of data. I first reduced the sample of tweets to English tweets only, then I removed URLs, usernames with the \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo; symbol in front of them, strings such as \u0026ldquo;RT\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;via,\u0026rdquo; and all common English stem words (\u0026ldquo;and,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rdquo;, etc.). Except for when I analyze the hashtags, I typically remove hashtags as well.\nThe Left-Right Distribution of Kekistan: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation I begin by estimating the ideological placement of individuals in the Kekistan ecosystem. I say \u0026ldquo;ecosystem\u0026rdquo; to indicate that our most general sample will be bound to include users with varying relationships to Kekistan; it will be mostly proud Kekistanis, of course, but also some random non-affiliated interlocutors and a few attackers chiming in on these keywords. To deal with this problem, I\u0026rsquo;ve manually removed the obvious \u0026lsquo;false positives\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve happened to notice, such as one account dedicated explicitly to anti-Kek activism, but with several thousand cases, I cannot go through them all manually. The solution, then, is to conduct analyses also on conservatively defined subsets of the sample. Thus, for all analyses below, I check my results against subsets including only accounts offering the explicit Kekistani identifications \u0026ldquo;Praise Kek,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Kekistani,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Free Kekistan.\u0026rdquo; This reduces the sample to only 621 users, which is a large loss of information about most Kekistanis, but they\u0026rsquo;re likely to be only die-hard Kekistani activists.\nI estimate the \u0026lsquo;Bayesian ideal point\u0026rsquo; for each user with a method developed and validated by Pablo Barberá (2015). The method is very sophisticated but the intuition is simple: we can estimate the ideology of any given user by considering the known ideological slants of the elite users they follow. You can easily think of some issues with of this method (e.g. it draws a blank for accounts that don\u0026rsquo;t follow elite users, or what about users that want to monitor their enemies?) but Barberá has shown that it produces results highly consistent with other known measures of ideological placement. With a decent sample, I think we can be fairly confident the results will give us a pretty reliable, general sense of the ideological distribution of Kekistan.\nThe resulting estimates are relative, in the sense that they do not map onto any a priori standard for what defines \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo; They only allow us to place each user in relation to all the others, on a scale representing the left-right dimension. To gain a sense of how the ideological distribution of Kekistan maps onto our intuitions about how far left or right someone is, we can compare the Kekistanis to some other Twitter accounts whose ideological character is already well known: politicians. Therefore, in the figures below, I include as useful signposts the ideological placements of one far-left politician, Bernie Sanders, and a far-right politician, Ted Cruz, derived with the same technique we use for the Kekistanis.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the ideological distribution within Kekistan, first for the whole sample of Kekistan-participants and second for the smaller subset of explicitly identified Kekistani \u0026ldquo;citizens,\u0026rdquo; with vertical lines indicating the estimates for Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz. This analysis suggests that Kekistan is generally a right-wing country (though not any further to the right than Ted Cruz), and with a fascinating long-tail of lefties. If you define the borders of Kekistan in the broadest way (Figure 1), Senator Sanders would likely be quite at home with a small minority of Kekistanis. He wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be the most radical. Even among the Kekistani activist elite, Senator Sanders is within their ideological range, although he would be the farthest left among them.\nThe Issue Priorities of Kekistan Perhaps the next best way to investigate the composition of the Kekistani citizenry is to analyze the self-authored user descriptions. This is the primary place where users articulate their identity. A common practice is to list keywords and hashtags that best describe your interests. If we look at the hashtags in Kekistanis\u0026rsquo; self-descriptions as indicators of their top-priority beliefs, a fairly clear picture emerges. More than anything else, Kekistanis talk about Trump and Making America Great Again. But these are ambiguous, high-level, symbolic focal points aggregating any number of beliefs and interests, whereas what we would really like to know is: What are the specific beliefs and interests that drive Kekistani Trumpism? The first answer is that free speech emerges as the top substantive issue that Kekistanis care about. The second answer is that there are many specific issues that only a small number of Kekistanis care about and they do not make a lot of sense. Again, there is a long tail in issue priorities, just as there is a long tail in the ideological distribution.\nRestricting our attention to the hardcore activists, the substantive interpretation remains largely the same, although the diversity of long-tail issues decreases. Atheists are a greater proportion in the explicit activist subset, interestingly, so it seems that Kekistan is a country that includes some Christians but is run by the godless\u0026ndash;presumably\nNetwork of Issue/Identity Associations in Kekistan The network view of the words used in user descriptions shows that, roughly, there is one camp of patriotic/nationalist, libertarian/conservatives who are likely white, Christian, and former military; then there is a second camp of what you might call \u0026ldquo;humanists,\u0026rdquo; interested in gaming, anime, music, and Youtube. There appears to be a third camp consisting of Kekistan\u0026rsquo;s apolitical civil service who focus primarily on distributing memes and news about Kekistan, for instance, the \u0026ldquo;Official Homepage of Kekistani Bureau of Memetic Warfare.\u0026rdquo; This is just an informal reading of the network graph.\nA Closer Look at the Kekistani Left Our estimates of the ideological distribution showed a non-trivial long tail of leftists, so I want to give this finding a closer look. One risk is that the long tail we observed reflects anti-Kek users, who entered our sample only because they invoked Kekistani identifiers in their attacks on Kekistani accounts. I therefore mined user descriptions for the character string \u0026ldquo;left,\u0026rdquo; to get a better sense of some examples. I include \u0026ldquo;centrist\u0026rdquo; descriptions that disavow both the left and right. This list is not complete, as surely there are leftist users who do not have \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; anywhere in their description. These examples just give one a sense of what I have suspected: Kekistan includes a non-trivial sub-population of leftists, former leftists, and centrists the primary concern of whom is free speech.\n   Example user descriptions of non-right-wing Kekistanis     Wokeperson for the Republic of Kekistan.

A Closer Look at Kekistani Racism Defining racism objectively is difficult. There\u0026rsquo;s a definite presence of individuals in Kekistan who assert the fact of their whiteness. Many people would say this is racist; in academic social science and certainly in the humanities this would probably be a near-consensus view. Many people outside of academia would argue that this is not racist. A lot of my work recently is on the wager that serious problems are opening up between academic consensus and our larger social reality, and that it\u0026rsquo;s precisely this gap we should try to open up empirically. For that reason I really want to try to keep my quantitative analyses as culture-war-neutral as possible, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on the more specific claim that Kekistan is fascist or white supremacist. Regardless of whether references to one\u0026rsquo;s whiteness is racist in some sense, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not fascist and/or white supremacist per se. Let\u0026rsquo;s define fascist white supremacist as someone giving an indication that whites are somehow better or more valuable than non-whites. Technically, \u0026ldquo;white nationalist\u0026rdquo; does not necessarily imply racist evaluations in the sense I just gave, but we\u0026rsquo;ll err on the side of generosity to the \u0026ldquo;Kek is racist\u0026rdquo; claim by including users who use the phrase \u0026ldquo;white nationalist\u0026rdquo; to describe themselves. I began by searching user descriptions for \u0026ldquo;race\u0026rdquo; OR \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; and then combing them manually for white supremacy according to this definition. In the interest of transparency, I will note that there are a few cases that may be \u0026ldquo;dog-whistling\u0026rdquo; racism, but I don\u0026rsquo;t include these because without a sharp line it\u0026rsquo;d be very hard to quell my suspiciousness in a consistent way. To be fair, there are also a lot of anti-racist accounts in this subset, which I\u0026rsquo;m also not reporting here.\n   Example user descriptions of white-supremacist and/or white nationalist Kekistanis     I am a brave knight of Kekistan, destroyer of cucks and purger of the extreme left and right.

I noticed there were also a few explicit anti-racist or anti-nationalist descriptions. If you look at #Kek tweets mentioning \u0026ldquo;Nazi,\u0026rdquo; they are overwhelmingly to the effect that Kek is not Nazi, or that Kek is anti-Nazi.\nThe General Meaninglessness of Kekistani Memefare I conducted a series of analyses on the text of the Kekistan-related tweets. I looked at the most common words, their network graph, and even looked at topic models (a somewhat more sophisticated technique of identifying latent clusters of related words). In all cases, the results are completely uninteresting because they are almost purely comments about memes, and other self-referential comments related to their Right to Meme, MAGA, Trump, etc. I will spare you multiple graphs and tables repeating, ad infinitum, \u0026ldquo;memes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;spicymemes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;dankmemes,\u0026rdquo; etc. When Kekistanis say that Kekistan has no unified political agenda other than freedom of speech, I think we have to believe them because it is almost impossible to find any substantive political topics in their public \u0026ldquo;communications,\u0026rdquo; which are almost completely bereft of content. Much of their communicative activity seems to have the sole intention of simply inhabiting and protecting the space of offensiveness (or triggering the libtards, as they might say).\nThe Moral Foundations and Policy Positions of Kekistan We might still wonder about what Kekistani citizens and visitors area like \u0026ldquo;off the island,\u0026rdquo; as it were. What types of people are we really dealing with here? To explore this further, I now turn to the 2.6 million tweets I scraped from the user feeds of individuals who visited Kekistan at least once. Reminder, these tweets are mostly not about Kekistan; they are tweets about anything, by the people who represent Kekistan as a distributed \u0026ldquo;movement.\u0026rdquo; Given the above subsection, finding that most Kekistani messaging is quite meaningless, I was doubtful about finding very much of interest in this larger sample of tweets. But here are some results.\nThe below figure shows the \u0026ldquo;moral foundations\u0026rdquo; (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009) of Kekistani citizens and visitors, relative to explicit Kekistani activists. I find it somewhat interesting that activists are less morally activated than the rest, which is perhaps counterintuitive. This is consistent with the view that Kekistanis are mostly just interested in meaningless shitposting, to hold the space of offensiveness. Of all the foundations they seem to care a lot about Harm (one of the key left-wing foundations), but interestingly they care least about Fairness (the other key left-wing foundation.) Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll investigate this more thoroughly at a later date, for now I put this here just for good measure.\nThe figure below shows an estimate of policy position-takings, using a dictionary developed by Laver and Garry (2000). One drawback to this dictionary is it was designed for use in the British context, so it will not work optimally in a foreign country as strange as Kekistan. That said, there\u0026rsquo;s no harm in seeing what gets turned up using this method. Note that the economy categories including the \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; symbol refer to the position that there should be neither more nor less government intervention in the economy; the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; sign means more intervention, and the \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; sign means less. And so on. As you can see below, insofar as there is any pattern (which I would not make too much of, either way, given what we have found so far), the pattern is: no particularly obvious left-right mapping. Law and Order Conservatism appears as the most common position, second only to neutral positions on government intervention in the economy, but the next most common position is for more intervention in the economy. So maybe Kekistan is culturally conservative and economically liberal? Perhaps one point of interest is that gender and ethnic political positions do not appear with notable frequency in the user feeds of Kekistani citizens, visitors, or activists. This would speak against the \u0026ldquo;Kekistan is misogynist and white nationalism\u0026rdquo; arguments. I would not personally make too much of this one, given what we\u0026rsquo;ve already found and the notably mixed positions that follow below in this graph. This method either has a lot of error when applied to an international sample on Twitter, or else there\u0026rsquo;s a rather confusing mix of different positions. Again I am including this simply for good measure, as perhaps it will stimulate some future hypothesis or be interesting to someone working on something else.\nConclusion Overall, I would summarize Kekistan as a virtual \u0026ldquo;country\u0026rdquo; populated by emigrants from existing countries who all share a strong commitment to free speech (and nearly nothing else). While the center of gravity is certainly to the right, it is unlikely to be much farther to the right (if at all) than the right-wing of the American Congress. An overwhelming majority of these right-wing Kekistanis express no interest in racial politics (indeed, it is clear that the Kekistani \u0026ldquo;ethnicity\u0026rdquo; is mostly a mockery of anyone who cares very much about ethnic identity). That said, there is a clear non-trivial minority of explicit racists and White Nationalists. Most interestingly, I find clear evidence that there is a non-trivial \u0026ldquo;long tail\u0026rdquo; of centrists and even leftists, using a technique for Bayesian ideal point estimation that has been validated by previous research (Barberá 2015). The result generally holds even for the most explicitly identified Kekistani individuals, and it also bears manual, qualitative scrutiny. As a whole, there is almost no substantial political topic that Kekistanis talk about together, other than memes, Trump, MAGA, Pepe, etc. While many would be inclined to take this as evidence that Kekistan has a latent racist character generally (because Trump is seen as a unifier of white racism), I think the upshot of this analysis is different.\nAlthough Kekistan\u0026rsquo;s favorite American politician is Donald Trump, the most empirically warranted interpretation, in my view, is that Kekistani Trump supporters love The Donald primarily because they love freedom of speech above all else. Racism or white supremacy is simply not the shared factor explaining why thousands of people have moved to (or occasionally vacation in) the country of Kekistan. To the degree there is a \u0026ldquo;top issue,\u0026rdquo; it is clearly \u0026ldquo;free speech.\u0026rdquo; Beyond this, Kekistanis are individually interested in a variety of different ideas and lifestyles, from Atheism to Christianity, from Nationalism to cyberanarchist Crypto, and even from White Nationalism to Antifascism.\nA final reflection is that the Kekistani left seems to flagrantly reject what we might call the \u0026ldquo;guilt contagion model\u0026rdquo; of political affiliation, which is the dominant perspective in the mainstream activist left. The \u0026ldquo;contagion model\u0026rdquo; is shorthand for the idea that using any symbols that are used by anyone with any views you find loathsome \u0026ldquo;infects\u0026rdquo; you with the guilt belonging to the people with the loathesome views. To the average radical leftist in public today, as I learned quite explicitly from my former comrades, saying or doing anything related to \u0026ldquo;Kek\u0026rdquo; is bad because you can find some examples of bad people with bad ideas using this symbol. Obviously the Kekistani Left is distinct from the activist left in that they do not fear contracting guilt by association: they believe strongly in free speech, and if a few racists also believe in free speech, who cares? Well, many people on the left care tremendously, but Left-Kekistanis must not. This variable sensitivity to \u0026ldquo;guilt contagion via communication\u0026rdquo; strikes me as one of the most salient cleavages within the left today.\nOn the whole, these findings are quite anomolous for most currently available explanations of the \u0026ldquo;online culture wars\u0026rdquo; and the online \u0026ldquo;Alt-Right\u0026rdquo; more generally. Rather, I think these findings are pretty consistent with the hypothesis I sketched in the introduction, that the so-called \u0026ldquo;Alt-Right\u0026rdquo; is incorrectly named in a way that is itself a function of the culture wars. It seems more likely that what is called the \u0026ldquo;Alt-Right\u0026rdquo; is in fact a wide variety of unaligned interests seeking escape from the dominant institutionally-sponsored version of reality. They want free speech and they are willing to take it, no matter what you might call them, and even if people they dislike happen to use the same hashtag. These diverse energies being lumped together as \u0026ldquo;Alt-Right\u0026rdquo; are simply all the energies that the dominant institutionalized Left does not like, including left-libertarian tendencies. In other words, the \u0026ldquo;Alt-Right\u0026rdquo; is not even all Right.\nReferences Barberá, P., (2015).

It seems that perhaps in the pushback against political correctness, many have been too quick to make generalizations about how \u0026ldquo;the far left\u0026rdquo; and/or \u0026ldquo;radical liberals\u0026rdquo; think about free speech. The now popular view that \u0026ldquo;the left\u0026rdquo; has turned against free speech is not totally wrong, but it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. The important wrinkle is that \u0026ldquo;extreme liberals\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;far left\u0026rdquo; have always been, and generally remain, the most supportive of free speech. Curiously, it is the \u0026ldquo;slightly left\u0026rdquo; that have in recent years turned against free speech (and only for racists, not for other groups, including military fascists!).\nFor most of its surveys between 1972 and 2016, the General Social Survey asked a U.S. sample to consider the following types of potential public speakers. (They asked about a few others but the following are the ones they asked most consistently.)\n \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;a person who believes that Blacks are genetically inferior.\u0026rdquo; (Henceforth \u0026ldquo;racist.\u0026rdquo;) \u0026ldquo;Somebody who is against all churches and religion\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Henceforth \u0026ldquo;antitheist.\u0026rdquo;) \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;a man who admits he is a Communist.\u0026rdquo; (Henceforth \u0026ldquo;communist.\u0026rdquo;) \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;a person who advocates doing away with elections and letting the military run the country.\u0026rdquo; (Henceforth \u0026ldquo;militarist.\u0026rdquo;) \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;a man who admits that he is a homosexual?\u0026rdquo; (Henceforth, \u0026ldquo;homosexual.\u0026rdquo;)  For each type of person, they also asked, \u0026ldquo;If such a person wanted to make a speech in your community, should he be allowed to speak, or not?\u0026rdquo;\nExploring this data, I found a few striking insights. Figure 1 presents the basic trends. The graph shows the proportion of respondents who said the speaker should be allowed, for each speaker type. Figure 2 presents the trends, broken down by ideological self-identification (\u0026ldquo;liberal\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; on a 5-category Likert scale). The term \u0026ldquo;liberal\u0026rdquo; is a notoriously loaded term in American politics, but among all the ideological self-placement questions asked by the GSS this one has the most data. Later, we check our findings against one 2014 question that asks respondents how they place themselves on a \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; scale.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the first interesting insight from Figure 2. As late as the 1970s \u0026amp; 1980s, the Left \u0026amp; the Right were, compared to today, relatively ambivalent about letting people, especially their ideological enemies, speak freely. Many conservatives did not wish to give freedom of speech to groups they were inclined to dislike, such as homosexuals and atheists. Liberals were less willing to give speech rights to militarists than they are today. But since then, the left and the right have become more tolerant to the free speech of many groups. Except racists. What\u0026rsquo;s unique about today\u0026rsquo;s fashion of \u0026ldquo;no platforming\u0026rdquo; racists (really, anyone deemed racist) is not that it\u0026rsquo;s new; what\u0026rsquo;s unique is that this specific type of speaker was exempt from the generally rising tide of speech toleration over the past few decades. Today\u0026rsquo;s vaguely leftist fashion of \u0026ldquo;no platforming\u0026rdquo; anyone deemed racist does not reflect a sudden, massive shift of opinion (although there\u0026rsquo;s some shift); it seems more to reflect a quite traditional tendency of aversion to despised speakers, which only now appears peculiar because most other despisable speaker types have become tolerated by most other ideological factions. The general, national puzzle, therefore, is not \u0026ldquo;Why do leftists suddenly seem so opposed to racist speakers, or speakers deemed racist?\u0026rdquo; This is a puzzle, which we\u0026rsquo;ll address next, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the over-arching puzzle. The most general puzzle is \u0026ldquo;Why have racist speakers, or speakers deemed racist, been exempt from the rising tide of speech toleration, for liberals and conservatives?\u0026rdquo; As Figure 1 shows, the relatively stable attitudes toward racist speakers are visible as nationwide averages, ignoring ideology. I won\u0026rsquo;t try to provide an answer for this question here, as clarifying the question seems worthwhile enough for the moment.\nThe second important fact shown in Figure 2 is that generally, on average, support for free speech increases as you move from conservatism to liberalism. To any political scientist, this should not be surprising; liberals are known to be higher in openness than conservatives, and conservatives have always been more concerned with social control (law and order). This is only interesting as a corrective for claims that have become very popular in the alt-ideological indie media world. This is understandably due to the presence of high-profile left-wing ideologues opposed to free speech—and the presence of high-profile free speech defenders who happen to lean center-right/libertarian. I think I have heard on separate occasions people such as Bret Weinstein, Dave Rubin, Joe Rogan and others, all talk about how puzzling it is that liberalism/leftism used to be the camp of free speech but now they\u0026rsquo;re the camp of speech suppression. This is not really true. I think what they should say, and maybe what they mean to say, is that \u0026ldquo;a puzzling minority of vaguely leftist activists, who happen to have gained media attention, wish to suppress free speech.\u0026rdquo;\nFun random factoid: extreme conservatives and extreme liberals are the two ideological groups with the highest average tolerance for racist speakers (maybe for different reasons).\nThe third most fascinating insight from Figure 2 is where, exactly, there has been some opinion shift away from free speech in recent years. If there\u0026rsquo;s one segment of the ideological spectrum that has become the most censorious toward racists, it is not the Extreme Liberal but rather the Liberal and Slightly Liberal. In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s likely not Liberalism itself doing the work here, if Extreme Liberals are the most supportive of free speech for racists. As mentioned above, those who identify as \u0026ldquo;extremely liberal\u0026rdquo; have always been, on average, the most supportive of free speech (even for racist speakers). Historical phenomena such as the left-wing Berkely Free Speech movement of the 1960s has not been reversed by contemporary SJWs; extreme liberals carry on that tendency, the inference here is simply that SJWs are actually not extreme liberals.\nThe fourth and final interesting observation to be made here is that people who would \u0026ldquo;no platform\u0026rdquo; racists are substantially more willing to let speak people who preace literal military takeover of the government. The label \u0026ldquo;militarist\u0026rdquo; in the GSS data is somewhat understated. Militarist here means \u0026ldquo;a person who advocates doing away with elections and letting the military run the country.\u0026rdquo; It is fascinating, given that anti-racism is often rhetorically linked to anti-fascism, that while 60% of Slight Liberals would allow racists to speak, almost 80% of Slight Liberals would allow a speaker preaching military fascism. This suggests to me that the vociferous wish to suppress anyone labeled \u0026ldquo;racist\u0026rdquo; is driven by an underlying psychology distinct from aversion to fascism.\nI finish with a robustness check. One might object that my finding about the \u0026ldquo;Slight Leftist Speech Suppressor,\u0026rdquo; which surprisingly exonerates the radical leftists from the speech suppression tendency, might be a false artificat of the ambiguous meaning of the term \u0026ldquo;liberal.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps one could say that survey questions measuring \u0026ldquo;liberalism\u0026rdquo; are not accurate measures of leftism because they may be tapping Classical Liberalism (more libertarian than leftist). I used the \u0026ldquo;liberalism\u0026rdquo; measure of ideology because it had the most data over time, but we can check our findings against survey questions asking about \u0026ldquo;leftism,\u0026rdquo; although they have much less data. Figure 3 plots average willingess to let speak the main right-leaning speakers of interest for 11 different levels of ideological self-placement from \u0026ldquo;Left\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; where zero is equal to \u0026ldquo;Left\u0026rdquo; and 10 is equal to \u0026ldquo;Right.\u0026rdquo; This particular question was the most recent one invoking \u0026ldquo;the left\u0026rdquo; specifically, it was asked in 2014 only.\nThe same pattern appears to hold. It\u0026rsquo;s not those who identify with the \u0026ldquo;far left\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;radical left\u0026rdquo; who are the most notably opposed to racist speakers. It\u0026rsquo;s those who place themselves as a 4 on a left-right scale from 0-10.\nAs always, a few caveats are in order. This was a relatively modest first look into this data, and several improvements could be made. One could have shown error bars around the yearly aggregate point estimates, giving the reader a sense of the variance. One could have applied survey weights to optimize the point estimates. Some of the differences/comparisons discussed here are quite small, there is always some risk of finding signal in noise. Such exploratory investigations are useful primarily for their negative diagnostic value (showing what kinds of claims cannot be supported by the data); with respect to all of the positive claims suggested here, these are best understood as hypotheses suggested by the data, not certainties demonstrated once and for all by this data.\n","date":1518739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"18a94e2aed1d7cf3d414e6f77bf79082","permalink":"/blog/2018/02/16/who-is-afraid-of-free-speech/","publishdate":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2018/02/16/who-is-afraid-of-free-speech/","section":"post","summary":"The pushback against political correctness has led to overly hasty generalizations about leftist opposition to free speech.

The term SJW, short for social justice warrior, is now a well-known piece of internet slang. It refers to a particular tendency within left-wing political activism today. People often ask me to define \u0026ldquo;social justice warrior\u0026rdquo;, or they ask: \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that just an epithet, like \u0026lsquo;political correctness,\u0026rsquo; used by conservatives to dismiss the claims of marginalized people?\u0026rdquo; Or else it is sometimes suggested that such an ideologically loaded term is beneath a Serious Social Scientist. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about these questions a lot, and my sense is that SJW seems to reasonably distinguish a particular dimension of left-wing ideology and behavior from the larger multidimensional umbrella of \u0026ldquo;the Left.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether SJW is a defensible analytical construct is ultimately an empirical question. Is \u0026ldquo;SJW\u0026rdquo; a term that conservatives use, without logical constraint, to dismiss any lefty they feel like dismissing? Or does SJW name a particular type of leftist statistically distinguishable from other leftists?\nData and Method: Self-identified SJWs on Twitter How might we do this? One approach would be to list clear, observable criteria that we believe define SJWism, and which distinguish it from leftism in general. We could then go find people who meet the criteria; collect data on their speech or behavior; and compare them to the general population and/or other leftists. One immediate problem with this approach is that many leftists would deny being SJWs, no matter how much they matched our definition. This would seem to preclude the intersubjective consensus to which science generally aspires.\nAfter thinking about this for a while, one possibly clever solution dawned on me. A non-trivial number of leftists on the internet self-identify as SJWs. Although they are often being ironic, of course, their decision to own the label suggests they are likely the same individuals right-wingers have in mind when they use the term pejoratively. While there is likely significant normative disagreement between ironically self-identified SJWs and their right-wing critics about what the SJW persona means, self-identification with SJWism provides a reasonably attractive solution for how to draw an empirical sample of this vexing, semi-mythical ideological faction.\nTo investigate whether SJWs are empirically distinguishable from other leftists, I collected more than a million Twitter status updates by more than 500 individuals who self-identify as \u0026ldquo;SJW\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;social justice warrior\u0026rdquo; in their Twitter bio. I manually checked the accounts and removed cases where SJW was used in other ways, (e.g. as initials for someone\u0026rsquo;s full name.) I then collected a similarly sized sample of tweets drawn randomly from the Twitterverse, and a similarly sized sample from accounts whose profile includes the phrase \u0026ldquo;FeelTheBern.\u0026rdquo; These are our reference groups: the average user, and then Bernie Sanders supporters. The intuition for isolating Bernie Sanders supporters is that their broader-based, often class-centric, democratic socialism likely revolves around principles different than those at the core of SJWism. To be sure, there would certainly be SJWs within the camp of \u0026ldquo;Berners,\u0026rdquo; but the center of gravity is likely different. Note, however, that this overlap is not a problem for us; in fact, it will only make differences between SJWs and Berners harder to distinguish statistically, which means that, if I identify some, this confounding should increase rather than decrease our confidence that these differences are real.\nIn future work I hope to pursue this question in greater detail, but for this blog post, I am curious about the possibility that SJWs have different \u0026ldquo;moral foundations\u0026rdquo; compared to the average leftist. Moral Foundations Theory may help. Jonathan Haidt and his co-authors have identified specific moral foundations, some of which help to explain the difference between leftists and conservatives (see Haidt\u0026rsquo;s book The Righteous Mind). Might these differences in the sense of moral justice also help to explain SJWism as a deviation from general leftism?\nAnalysis After reducing the samples to English-only status updates, I then reduced the two largest corpora to equal the smallest of the three. Each final corpus consists of 894,337 tweets. I then applied the Moral Foundations Dictionary developed by Graham and Haidt, using the R package quanteda. One question is whether SJWs are generally more moralistic. A first look at the total number of moral features across the three corpora shows that SJWs are not generally more moralistic than Berners. For both groups, there are about .3 moral features per tweet, on average (about .32 for Berners and .3 for SJWs). Unsurprisingly, both activist tendencies invoke moral terms more frequently than in the random sample of tweets (20% moralistic.)\nFigure 1 plots, for each corpus of tweets, the number of moral features in each category, divided by the total number of tweets in the corpus. This gives us a sense of how much each group emphasises each moral foundation, relative to their whole output. Figure 1 shows only the 5 primary foundations identified by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, plus a separate category for general moral terms that do not clearly fall into any of the moral foundations. As you can see from Figure 1, SJWs and Berners do not use moral terms very often, but certainly more often than the random sample.\nFigure 2 plots the same data at a finer resolution, breaking each foundation into positive/virtuous terms and negative/vice terms. This plot highlights how general moralistic language seems uniquely common among SJWs, a point I will return to in the Discussion section.\nFigure 3 plots the relative frequency of moral words, which gives us a sense of how important each foundation is relative to the other foundations, within each corpus. The values here are equal to 1 within each corpus.\nNext I consider the degree to which the different moral foundations are correlated within each corpus. Such correlations might provide a somewhat richer sense of the moral priorities of each group, by showing whether each camp is more or less likely to link certain foundations. Figures 4 and 5 show visualizations of feature co-occurence matrices for SJWs and Berners, respectively. The size and color of each circle reflects the number of tweets in which one moral feature co-occurs with another moral feature.\nThe main point of interest about the feature co-occurence matrices\u0026ndash;the main way that SJWs differ from Berners in their linkage of moral concepts\u0026ndash;is that Berners are inclined to link Loyalty and Harm more than SJWs.\nDiscussion Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with certain observations the data, interestingly, do not support. SJWs do not appear especially concerned with Purity, as one common perception suggests. Also, it is somewhat surprising to me that Fairness is not more frequently invoked by Berners or SJWs. My understanding of Haidt\u0026rsquo;s work is that left-wingers care the most about Harm and Fairness, so I guess I was expecting these to be the social justice foundations, and Fairness to be much more salient for both groups. After looking into the Moral Foundations dictionary, I think this pattern might be due to idiosyncratic word usage specific to left-wing radicalism, which confounds the dictionary definitions. For instance, the word \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; appears in the dictionary under \u0026ldquo;Authority (Virtue)\u0026rdquo; but in radical left circles I believe this word will more likely reflect the Fairness foundation. On the left today, \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; will generally refer more to economic inequality than cultural hierarchy.\nThere are a few, possibly meaningful and interpretable differences. It is interesting that Harm appears to loom marginally larger in the Berner camp, relative to SJWs. This is perhaps most interesting as a negative diagnostic: this would speak against the possibility that SJWs are hyper-concerned with Harm in particular\u0026ndash;a possibility I have wondered about.\nOne difference that is consistent with my expectations is that, relative to Berners, SJWs are more likely to use general moralistic language outside of the five primary moral foundations. I find this quite interesting because I have often noted that one defining characteristic of what is SJW is what seems to be a particularly unconstrained linguistic instrumentalism, i.e., concepts of moral justice are deployed in wildly diverse and inconsistent ways to advance essentially non-moral interests of the speaker. I have written extensively on how modern instrumental rationality short-circuits the possibility of radical social change. I have therefore thought for some time that perhaps SJWs are like the vanguard of a new, shamelessly instrumental version of the left-wing tradition: whereas normal people deploy language in self-serving ways to rationalize their moral intutions, and leftists generally deploy language that reflects their greater concern for Harm relative to conservatives, perhaps SJWism follows from the realization that moralism is a useful tool with or without any felt moral intuitions. This would be consistent with the finding here that SJWs are relatively more likely to use moralistic language outside of the five moral tastebuds Jonathan Haidt and colleagues have found to be primary across cultures. It would also be consistent with my writings on the detrimental pervasiveness of instrumentalism in left-wing activism. SJWism: left-wing moralism without foundations?\nSJWs are somewhat less likely to invoke Authority and Loyalty, relative to Berners. Again we should be careful not to over-interpret what are quite small differences, but we can still reflect on possible interpretations\u0026ndash;especially if the few small differences seem to make sense together. The lower degree of Authority emphasis is interesting because it speaks against the common description of the politically correct, SJW left as \u0026ldquo;authoritarian.\u0026rdquo; The lower degree of Loyalty emphasis is interesting because it speaks against SJWism as an esoteric, cult-like sect\u0026ndash;a perception outsiders sometimes have, given the highly idiosyncratic, specialist vocabulary associated with SJWism (\u0026ldquo;intersectionality,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;safe spaces,\u0026rdquo; etc.) There are no noticeable differences on Purity or Fairness.\nWith respect to the co-occurence matrices, I noted above that Berners are inclined to link Loyalty and Harm more than SJWs. I did not examine examples, but I wager this linkage reflects the democratic-socalist logic of \u0026ldquo;Capitalism harms people so we all have to stick together.\u0026rdquo; Harm is bad but solidarity is good. Not only is solidarity good, but it can defeat the harms, etc. This makes sense in relation to the first graphs: Berners appear to deploy a somewhat richer web of moral concepts, whereas SJWs are more likely to use generalized moral terms in relatively unpatterned ways.\nConclusion Can the analyses presented here speak to the question of what is a social justice warrior?\nBy collecting a large writing sample of self-identified \u0026ldquo;social justice warriors\u0026rdquo; on Twitter (more than a million status updates from more than 500 different users), I have been able to provide one of the first empirical investigations of this semi-mythical, politically correct persona. In contemporary politics, the investigation of ideological micro-factions is uniquely difficult because of highly decentralized, rapidly changing, strategically motivated language use. I have leveraged the practice of ironic self-identification with pejorative monikers as a reasonable solution to the problem of drawing a fair sample. On the whole, linguistically observable differences in the moral psychology of self-identified SJWs and one alternative left-wing reference group (Bernie Sander supporters) are small but suggestive, and theoretically sensible. The small size of the differences could be due to the research design: given some degree of SJWism within the Bernie Sanders camp, the small differences we observe here might appear more clearly if we could draw a brighter line between groups. We could have compared SJWs to anti-SJWs but the hard and crucial test is whether SJWs are different from other leftists. We also noted at least one example of how the Moral Foundations dictionary might be confounded by idiosyncratic language use on the radical left, which also might have caused us to underestimate the differences between our groups. Obviously, more research is needed, beyond this short blog post, to know whether the differences identified here are real and significant.\nThat said, what is the takeaway here? I might hazard the following. On the whole, the language of SJWs appears somewhat less morally constrained than the alternative activist reference group. By morally unconstrained I refer to a cluster of small but linked observations that emerged from the data here. In some sense, this is likely just because SJWs are not an organized movement, as Bernie Sanders supporters are, to some degree. But this is interesting to learn anyway, precisely because SJWs are often interpreted as if they are an organized, morally coherent \u0026ldquo;movement\u0026rdquo; of some kind.\nFirst, SJWs are less morally constrained in the sense that they appear less driven by the primary, biologically coherent moral intuitions that have been observed consistently across cultures. Second, we also saw an \u0026ldquo;unconstrained\u0026rdquo; quality in the co-occurrence of moral features. For SJWs, the different moral foundations observed within their documents are less correlated. Whereas Berners are somewhat inclined to link Harm and Loyalty, this is less the case with SJWs. That SJWs invoke Loyalty less than Berners also seems to suggest that SJWs are relatively less likely to celebrate good \u0026ldquo;members\u0026rdquo; and less likely to condem betrayal. Now, we know that SJWs certainly criticize and attack in-group and out-group members if and when they violate certain taboos, but from this analysis we might infer that they do so in generalized, non-foundational terms. A former in-group member who uses racist language, for instance, is perhaps not primarily guilty of betraying the group or \u0026ldquo;movement;\u0026rdquo; they are simply deserving of negative moral descriptors, and SJWs will use any number of them in diverse ways. While I do not test for this here directly, these observations are at least consistent with what I have written elsewhere about the social justice warrior or SJW representing a shamelessly instrumental wing of left-wing activism. Whereas most leftists instrumentally rationalize their own moral intuitions, as all partisans do, online and in the real world, perhaps SJWs are the vanguard of a more sophisticated level of self-interested rationalization: to set flight from the constraints of their own moral intuitions, which otherwise constrain the self-interested language use of the typical modern partisan. We certainly could not justify such a bold generalization from the data presented in this short blog post, but this is what the data have me wondering.\nAre there other questions it might be interesting to ask of this data, or a different data set? Let me know if you think of something and I will consider looking into it.\n","date":1515974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"a606d9244b956b3f6dd8203510e773e1","permalink":"/blog/2018/01/15/moral-foundations-of-social-justice-warriors/","publishdate":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2018/01/15/moral-foundations-of-social-justice-warriors/","section":"post","summary":"Are Social Justice Warriors a real ideological faction of the Left, with a unique moral psychology?

Does comparing Trump to Hitler decrease support for his policies? With the help of my students at the University of Southampton, we conducted a survey experiment to investigate the causal effect of a Hitler comparison on support for one of Trump's policies.\nThere are several reasons to expect that comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler could decrease support for policies of the Trump administration. First of all, we know that people are very sensitive to how political questions are worded. Simply putting the word “Hitler” into a description of a policy could shift respondents’ attitudes towards the policy in a negative direction, for the simple reason that the former leader of the Third Reich has a ubiquitously negative connotation. Research on priming shows that exposing someone to the word “yellow” will make them more likely to think of a banana than an apple, for instance. Similarly, exposing someone to the word “Hitler”, could prime them to think of evil rather than good. There could also be a framing effect at work. Introducing Hitler to a respondents’ thought process could shift their frame of reference, pushing their estimate of The Donald closer to the far end of extreme evil. Finally, a comparison to Hitler could function as a piece of information that informs the respondent about something they did not previously know about Trump or the Trump administration.\nWhile many critics of Trump assume the comparison to Nazism is a strong way to undermine his public support, there are also good reasons to believe comparisons to the infamous Nazi leader have no effect, or potentially even a positive effect on attitudes towards Trump’s policies. First, since the end of World War II, comparisons to Hitler for cheap rhetorical effect have become notoriously commonplace and abused. So-called Godwin’s Law suggests that “as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.” The overuse of comparisons to Hitler could leave this rhetorical tactic null and void to contemporary ears. Even more counter-intuitively, if respondents happen to really like Trump and his policies, then it could be possible for such analogies to actually increase support for the U.S. President's policies. This would be a theory of motivated reasoning. If you like Trump and his policies, then a comparison to Hitler could be experienced as a disruption to your psychological or emotional state, leading you to increase your support for The Donald's policies to counteract this threat to your mental state.\n Data and Method To investigate the question empirically, we designed a web survey experiment that subjected respondents to two different framings of a controversial policy associated with the Trump administration. By randomly assigning respondents to two different framings of the policy and then asking all respondents their opinion about the policy, we can estimate the effect of the Hitler comparison by looking at the difference in the average opinion of these two groups. In particular, we asked respondents how they felt about a national registry for Muslims, a policy which has been associated with the Trump adminstration and which Trump has refused to disavow. In the weeks before the survey was conducted (on November 22, 2016), a wide variety of online media outlets published content explicitly comparing the policy to Nazi policy.\nThe respondents who were randomly assigned to a simple description of the policy (the control group), were given the following text:\n Some politicians in the United States have proposed a nationwide registry for all Muslims in the country. The purpose of the registry would be to identify, track, and surveil all Muslims in order to prevent terrorism.\n The respondents who were randomly assigned to the treatment condition were given the same text but followed by an analogy to the infamous German leader and the Nazi regime in the run-up to the Holocaust:\n Some politicians in the United States have proposed a nationwide registry for all Muslims in the country. The purpose of the registry would be to identify, track, and surveil all Muslims in order to prevent terrorism. Critics have suggested this proposal is similar to how the Nazi regime built a registry to identify and track Jews before the Holocaust.\n After respondents were given either the control or treatment text, they were presented with the following instructions: “On a scale from 0 to 100, use the sliding scale below to indicate your opinion about this proposal.” Below this was a visual slider-scale, set to 50 by default, with the left-hand side of the scale labeled “Strongly disagree,” the middle labeled “Neutral,” and the right-hand side labeled “Strongly agree.”\nWe used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform to hire 120 individuals to take the survey. While a representative sample of the United States population would be ideal, Mechanical Turk provides an efficient and affordable approach arguably superior to other options such as recruiting undergraduate students. Clearly the pool of Mechanical Turk workers are not a representative sample, and therefore our results will not generalize to any known population. Previous research has found that the pool of respondents obtained through Mechanical Turk constitutes a more broad cross-section of society than undergraduate student bodies, and therefore permits more generalization than permitted by studies based on undergraduate students. Mechanical Turk workers are from many countries around the world; the most represented country is the United States and the second most represented country is India. The United States President Donald Trump is likely to be fairly well known internationally so we see no especially compelling reason why international respondents should be excluded; still, given the American context of the research question, we checked the robustness of the results presented below when the data is subsetted to U.S. respondents only. The results do not change appreciably.\nGiven the very short length of our one-page, one-item survey, we expect respondents to complete the survey rather rapidly. Yet overly rapid responses are not credible. Before analysis, we removed all respondents who spent less than 10 seconds on the survey. Another issue is that we identifed a small number of respondents who submitted more than once. In such cases, we kept the first response and removed the duplicate(s). The results reported below do not change appreciably if we include the duplicates or remove all duplicates.\n Results The resulting analytic sample consists of 95 observations. 48 respondents were assigned to the control group and 47 were assigned to the treatment group. The mean value of the dependent variable, support for a national registry, is 34.11 with a standard deviation of 38.86. Figure 1 displays a histogram of the distribution.\nDistribution of the dependent variable  To estimate the effect of the treatment, we use a simple regression model. Table 1 displays the results. The coefficient for “Treatment” indicates the difference in the average value of the dependent variable between the control and treatment groups. A positive sign would indicate the treatment group reported greater support for a national registry, while a negative sign would indicate the treatment group reported less support for a national registry. The number below the coefficient, in parentheses, is the standard error.\n Dependent variable:  Support for a registry Treatment3.287 (8.011)  Constant32.479*** (5.635)  Observations95 R20.002 Adjusted R2-0.009 Residual Std. Error39.037 (df = 93) F Statistic0.168 (df = 1; 93) Note:*p**p***p   The results suggest that those exposed to the comparison were slightly more favorable toward the proposal for a national registry, but the difference is not statistically distinguishable from zero. The estimated effect, represented by the coefficient, is 3.29 but the probability of observing such a small difference due to chance alone is too great for us to infer that the treatment had any causal effect.\nTo better understand the result of the experiment, Figure 2 displays the expected support for a registry among the control and treatment groups. The horizontal blue lines indicate the means and the grey areas represent the 95% confidence intervals around each mean. The overlap of the two grey areas around roughly the same level of support indicates that comparing the policy of a national registry for muslims to Nazi policy had no observable effect on the respondents to our survey.\nThe Effect of a Hitler Comparison   Conclusion Our study suggests that comparisons to Adolf Hitler’s policies may not undermine support for particular public policies today. Future research should consider whether the effect of Hitler comparisons might be conditional on the political ideology or partisanship of the individual. Previous research suggests that conservatives or Republicans may respond to such analogies with increased support for President Trump and/or his administration's policies, whereas leftists or Democrats may respond with decreased support. A limitation of this study is that we did not measure ideology or partisanship so we could not explore this question. A future study should explore this possibility.\n\n Overlaid kernel density plots for treatment and control groups  (function () { var script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.src = \"https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\"; document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script); })();  ","date":1512864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"f6a802dcf4079983dcd36b3c66c6fc46","permalink":"/blog/2017/12/10/what-is-the-effect-of-comparing-donald-trump-to-hitler/","publishdate":"2017-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/12/10/what-is-the-effect-of-comparing-donald-trump-to-hitler/","section":"post","summary":"Critics of U.S. President Donald Trump frequently compare him to Adolf Hitler.

A nice rule of thumb is given by the psychologist Thomas Gilovich. If we emotionally like the implication of something, our brain automatically asks \u0026ldquo;Can I believe it?\u0026rdquo; But if we don’t, our brain asks, \u0026ldquo;Must I believe it?\u0026rdquo;1 The difference might seem slight, but this asymmetry in how we process information leads to profound social confusion when it plays out iteratively over time. If you think you are above such pedestrian irrationality, you probably are not; this process operates through a system that is not conscious—in fact, it happens before conscious thought even begins. For years, lefties have gawked with amazement at the insistent stupidity of right-wing media bubbles, especially that of Fox News. Today, however, not only the “mainstream left” but even supposedly sophisticated left-wing critics appear increasingly comfortable with a level of cognitive functioning once peculiar to channels such as Fox News. The phenomenon of motivated reasoning explains why even smart people on the left appear to be getting dumber, at the same time they sincerely feel like they are more obviously correct than ever.\nThis recent Buzzfeed article about Milo is a beautiful case study of how the left is converging to equilibrium with Fox News rationality. I try to avoid writing about one-off media events, but sometimes one encounters such a perfect illustration of a larger phenomenon that it feels worthwhile to drudge through an otherwise insignificant piece of media noise. I’ve seen many articles from lefty outlets over the past few years that have made me think: this is basically Fox News. And I’ve repressed the urge to write about them because you should never give too much energy responding to noise. But this fruit is now so ripe that I feel like I should pluck it, lest someone else does a few weeks from now and I feel ashamed for my laziness.\nThe basic gist of this recent Buzzfeed article is that it purports to be an exposé on Milo’s hitherto secret white nationalism. It purports to be new proof that Milo is a real racist or fascist, who has been strategically hiding his true, fundamental politics. It does a pretty good job of imparting that feeling, so as a rhetorical effort the author is fairly successful. That is, of course, what the author is being paid to do. So, good work. But for anyone out there who is still interested in making the best possible inferences from the available data, this article does not appear to be anything more than the stoking of lefty cognitive biases. There\u0026rsquo;s basically nothing objectively significant in the story after you subtract all the rhetorical trappings of the exposé genre. For example, consider the network flowcharts that make it feel as if a secret cabal is being uncovered.\nImage from the article\nOne of them (above) is a three-person, linear chain—why is this presented in a network-styled flowchart? It’s not very hard to follow; the network-style graphic is so needless that it’s just one of the many indications the author may be doing something other than trying to aid our understanding.\nThe main thing I learned from the article is that Milo once wrote a story about the alt right. I never read it, and probably won’t read it now. But one thing I do know is that journalists who write stories regularly contact people who represent the object of the story. That Milo contacted people on the alt right, including proper neo-Nazis such as “Weev,” is utterly unsurprising and uninteresting. The alt right, by most definitions, includes some neo-Nazis. I admit I was surprised that Milo had positive adjectives for Weev, which I find horrifying. But this doesn’t make a story, without a serious accounting of the psychology and sociology at play, which would enable us to make some kind of meaningful and plausible interpretation. That Milo is a secret member of a white nationalist cabal is one possible interpretation, but it just doesn’t hold up.\nI know and have worked with people who think Stalin and/or Mao were cool. I think support for Stalin and/or Mao is seriously reprehensible, yet I have some positive adjectives for some people who publicly like these figures. You can genuinely and deeply disagree with the harder edges of someone’s politics, even when they publicly identify with genocidal maniacs, and also have kind words about other aspects of their personality. People on the left do this all the time, don’t we? Either we are as evil as Milo who interacts kindly with the occasional neo-Nazi, or Milo having kind words for a neo-Nazi is not as evil as it seems. Leftists should be able to understand from introspection this psychology; you kind of just see them as dumb on that particular point, but because they are dumb and so fringe you can tolerate their evil tendencies as ridiculous, and appreciate their better aspects in the meantime. I don’t know what Milo really thinks, and as I said, I find it highly troubling to hear him speak kind words of someone who is a neo-Nazi. But if we are being honest and consistent with ourselves, that’s all one can really say from these little data points. Obviously, if Milo said he supports white nationalism or neo-Nazism, I would dislike and disavow Milo. All I am saying is that if kind words for admirers of genocidal maniacs is a yardstick of someone’s politics and character, then the right’s perennial, paranoid condemnation of the entire left as fundamentally murderous would be pretty reasonable. I don’t think that is reasonable. The left is now practicing the same logic, and it’s embarrassing.\nUltimately, I believe people should be judged by what they say in public about what they think and believe. Obviously we can and should make our own wagers about people based on all available information, but this includes making our own wagers about what exactly a Buzzfeed writer is doing when they write an article. If you trust the intentions and intellectual seriousness of a random Buzzfeed writer more than Milo’s repeated public statements disavowing white nationalism, that’s your prerogative, but consider the long-run implications. Once you start taking ideologically stylized recastings of data as more real than the data on which they are based, you are buckling up for a roller-coaster ride to wherever your preferred media wish to take you. This is the threshold at which your gradual departure from reality becomes irreversible and irredeemable, because any new data that could potentially pull you back to Earth can be ideologically recast by your trusted thought-leaders to further your shared drift into outer space.\nLet’s consider the other scandalous evidence of Milo\u0026rsquo;s secret fascist commitments. The article marshals details about racist interns and underlings Milo has worked with. Of course, if you start this article with the moral intuition that Milo is bad, then you will naturally read this data as scandalous evidence that Milo is more sinister than we thought. What you will systematically relegate as insignificant is all of the data that is actually surprisingly exonerating of Milo. All of the racist underlings cited in the article are cited in the context of Milo’s dislike for them (and for their racism), and his trying to distance himself from them. If you’re not already motivated to dislike Milo, this would appear to be evidence that Milo doesn’t seem to have much time for racists.\nFor a story purporting to expose Milo\u0026rsquo;s secret white nationalism, it was interesting to learn that Milo’s main collaborator and assistant is apparently not even white. I’m not sure, but in his picture he is not obviously white, and at the very least, he is referred to as having a “brown-sounding name.” If you are not predisposed to hate Milo, this might be a data point suggesting Milo is pretty cool with non-white people. Also, the article mentions that he is married to a black man, which I did not know. Again, maybe I’m crazy, but is this not a pretty hard test disconfirming the hypothesis that Milo is a white nationalist? I’m not saying, as the joke goes, that having a black friend clears you of any racism. But for an article purporting to show something new and deep about Milo’s true white supremacy, the data point of a black husband actually has a lot of leverage, in my view. White supremacists, white nationalists, and anti-black racists generally do not marry black people. It is the real mechanisms of motivated reasoning that make such a notable data point so easy to gloss over as if it’s meaningless (“He probably just married him as a publicity stunt to hide his real hatred for black people,” the rationalizing mind easily convinces itself, insanely).\nAlso notice the little random tidbits that question Milo\u0026rsquo;s character in a celebrity-gossip style, with basically no political content whatsoever. The featured quotes that basically just show Milo being mean to an intern, or being selfish with taking credit for joint work. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with pointing these things out, but again, as they have nothing to do with the big thesis of the article, they rather indicate what this piece really is: not a deep and significant political exposé, but a commodity for people who already feel that Milo is bad.\nWeirdly, the article has a long paragraph on how Milo interacts with a large and diverse audience — a 58-year-old Asian woman, a lesbian from Indiana, and even several accomplished lefties. He interacts a good deal with progressive journalists. The author seems to be so drunk on his own Kool-Aid that he assumes all of this is evidence of what? That fascist white nationalism is spreading to… Asian women and lesbians and the left? To anyone reading this article who is not already frothing with hatred for Milo, this paragraph is a wheelbarrow of pebbles to be placed on the “Milo is not a fascist” side of the scale.\nVox, which I thought was supposed to be higher-brow than Buzzfeed, interprets this all as evidence that “Yiannopoulos’s courting of the mainstream got results.” But an alternative interpretation is that Milo’s essential political content is appealing to a very large number of diverse and even progressive people. Maybe I’m biased, but this alternative interpretation strikes me as significantly more plausible. One reason you might not believe it is if you’re a paid progressive media writer, in which case the prospect of Milo appealing to the left would threaten the security of everything you’ve staked your name on over the past five to ten years. For this reason, the progressive media milieus may be condemned to further Fox-Newsification, even if the individuals involved would rather not pursue such a course.\nIt seems to me that Milo is primarily committed not to fascism or white nationalism but to transgressing certain norms, norms which are increasingly disliked by a wide and diverse swath of people. Unless of course you started the article wanting to dislike Milo, in which case Milo’s lefty interlocutors are evidence that his conspiracy is even larger than we thought. Worse than celebrity gossip, this is now \u0026ldquo;Flat Earth\u0026rdquo;-level cognitive functioning.\nThe funniest piece of evidence adduced by the author is the password alluding to Kristallnacht. What is a password? It is a secret, which you create specifically to be hard to guess. In other words, it is almost the exact opposite of \u0026ldquo;what someone believes.” It\u0026rsquo;s already known that Milo has an extreme taste for aggressive insensitivity. I could not think of something less interesting or indicative of his substantial political beliefs than a computer password. Imagine all the insane inferences someone could make if they went through all your old passwords looking for clues about your character. This degree of reaching is so pathetic that, again, the primary signal it sends to me is that I am reading a hopelessly motivated ideological commodity.\nIf there is any story here, it is that Milo is less ideologically right-wing, and even more non-ideologically opportunist, than many believe. If the article reveals anything, it is that Milo’s free speech absolutism is actually absolute; he is actively and passionately concerned about keeping in check any racist tendencies of his assistants and collaborators; he has no positive preference for white people, or aversion to non-white people; and his audience and interlocutors are more diverse in terms of ethnicity, gender, and ideology than many of us previously believed.\nThese inferences could be wrong. Maybe Milo is a new Hitler with an unprecedented superpower for misdirection. It’s hard to know because reality is hard to know. There is extraordinary uncertainty in the world. What I do know is simply that this article does not increase my estimated probability that Milo is a racist or white nationalist, and I find greatly troubling the chorus of lefty responses treating it as groundbreaking evidence for this inference. Not because Milo matters that much, but as an indicator of the cognitive seriousness of left media culture.\nIf you read this article and were scandalized by Milo\u0026rsquo;s secret fascism, it is probably because you opened it with the intention of finding Milo’s secret fascism. As lefty media culture has probably already blasted off into runaway, self-reinforcing irrationality dynamics, I\u0026rsquo;m sure this post will do nothing to reverse the process, but it helps me stay sane (I think, probably incorrectly).\n Gilovich, Thomas. 1991.

The event data is based on news reports.\n Banks, Arthur S., and Kenneth A. Wilson. Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Jerusalem, Israel: Databanks International, 2017. https://www.cntsdata.com.\n A common problem with cross-national historical data in political science is that countries enter and exit the international system of states. So global averages could potentially be misleading, especially if newer states are for some reason more or less conducive to rioting. For the main article, I report from the more general and complete sample of countries, but I also checked for this possible problem empirically. It turns out the story does not change substantially, whether you allow or disallow states to exit/enter the sample.\nThe 57 countries in the sample from 1919 to 2016 are:\nAfghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liberia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela\nThe global mean of country-level riots per person is not a good measure because it’s highly sensitive to riots in small countries.

There were prison riots and a jailbreak that year (Britannica). The three riots that year constitute a high proportion of the population rioting, for the simple reason that the the country has a small population (only 42,000 at the time).\n","date":1505174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"23148c534e41f775699026a5c71f6f40","permalink":"/blog/2017/09/12/rioting-decline-data/","publishdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/09/12/rioting-decline-data/","section":"post","summary":"Supplementary information for my article on the hidden decline of rioting.","tags":["academic research","data","pacification","radical politics"],"title":"Data appendix on global rioting dynamics","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"I’ve been curious about the new massive camp of Jordan Peterson acolytes. In one of my many prodigal late-night lurking sessions through the depths of Reddit, I noticed they collected some data on themselves. So here we go.\nIf you’ve been following my recent writing, podcasts, and videos, you’ll know I’m especially interested in the relationships between education, political correctness, taboo topics, and ideology.\nI’ve been hypothesizing that there is a substantial number of culturally conservative (against the cultural leftism of the West) but libertarian (let people do what they want, free speech, etc.) folks, who have been increasingly shut out from mainstream Western political culture for decades now. Not just from the left, but from a mainstream right that bows before cultural leftism (what the right internet lovingly refers to as “cucks”).\nIn many educated circles, support for Donald Trump is seen as somewhere between insane and evil, quite seriously. Yet, about 50% of the Americans who voted did so for him, so we know at least a non-trivial number of educated people voted for him. But who are they? I haven’t really had strong intuitions about this, and my sense is you just don’t really see or hear from educated and highly thoughtful Trump supporters. I’m aware this could definitely be “my bubble,” but I don’t think it’s just that. I think there exist thoughtful educated Trump supporters, but I think they are systematically unlikely to appear in mainstream culture.\nBut I have been watching closely the explosion of popularity enjoyed by academic psychologist Jordan Peterson, and it has seemed to me that his constituency might just be some of the educated Trumpians. It is also consistent with my “long-term mass suppression” thesis, because this helps to explain how a random academic psychologist achieved genuinely extraordinary, anomolous levels of fame all of a sudden. It’s the same pattern with Trump (though I’m not, at all, equating the two individuals): a massive unexpected and rise-to-power indicating a massive reservoir of public interest in something that has hitherto been systematically under-supplied by the status quo.\nSo with these ideas in mind, let’s take a look at support for Trump, education levels, and identifications in the “four quadrant” model of ideology.\nCorrelation plot Let’s look into the structure of the more specific beliefs in the survey.\n How many factors? The following graph shows how every additional factor explains less and less of the variance. Rule of thumb is that the optimal number of factors is the “elbow” in the graph. The different colors in the legend represent the different ways of calculating the optimal factor solution. Two of them suggest 3, and that’s the elbow, so we’ll go with 3 factors.\n## ## Loadings: ## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 ## Lower taxes -0.790 0.181 ## Nationalizing industries 0.513 -0.384 ## Marxism is a good idea 0.512 0.133 ## Universal healthcare 0.748 -0.245 -0.200 ## Flat tax -0.437 0.106 ## Equality of outcomes 0.554 0.149 0.315 ## Negative income tax -0.104 ## Free trade -0.276 0.287 -0.122 ## Abortion always legal 0.467 0.259 -0.180 ## Gun rights -0.552 0.155 ## Hate speech laws 0.614 ## Law enforcement -0.149 -0.320 ## Legalization of drugs 0.445 -0.196 ## Gender wage gap is real 0.627 0.225 0.261 ## Marriage should be supported -0.213 -0.492 0.133 ## Open borders 0.461 0.519 -0.109 ## Privacy 0.228 -0.195 ## Affirmative action 0.653 0.192 0.199 ## ## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 ## SS loadings 4.31 1.395 0.458 ## Proportion Var 0.24 0.078 0.025 ## Cumulative Var 0.24 0.317 0.342 This structure is pretty standard in political science. Factor 1 is economic conservatism vs. economic liberalism (leftism), Factor 2 is social conservatism vs. social liberalism.\nWhat I find interesting here Lo and behold, the data from /r/JordanPeterson seem broadly consistent with the hypothesis I sketched at the beginning.\nAs an ultralefty who is also 90% on board with Peterson’s key messages, I honestly did not expect this many of the Peterson disciples to be Trump supporters. I was thinking I’d find a sizable minority and say “Aha! A little evidence for my hypothesis.” But Trump is far and away the most favored candidate.\nThe reason this is important, in my view, is that Trump and Trump supporters are genuinely seen as unworthy of intellectually serious debate in progressive educated circles. But Peterson is an undeniable intellectual master of the most authentic kind. What this means is that genuinely educated progressives who are opposed to Trump need (if they are serious and sincere) to go through Peterson and his intellectual community. In other words, educated progressives cannot pretend there are no serious intellectual forces associated with Trump. There is at least one, and it’s the cluster of ideas Peterson has been working on for decades. To be clear, I am not saying Peterson has caused support for Trump and I’m not saying Peterson himself supports Trump (I don’t know, but he generally avoids naïve blanket identifications.) I am just saying that, as far as I can tell, his perspective represents a major, public intellectual force that coincides with at least some vectors of support for Trump.\nAnd the sizable minority of left libertarians makes sense to me (because that’s me, basically). So it’s interesting that left-libertarians are communicating thoughtfully in a community with many Trump supporters. I want to show this to all the left libertarian activists I know (who are very different than left libertarian people in general). To show them there is serious intellectual content in the new seeming “right-wing” ecology of ideas and figures, which they see as one big “alt-right” to be stopped by “no platforming” everything. But I probably won’t bother, because radical left activist types are generally not in the business of learning.\n This was just a short exploration. If you have any questions or additional analyses you would be super interested to see, leave a comment.\n ","date":1504656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570474528,"objectID":"f47b1d70b5aa84446aa1e8fbcd08a1d6","permalink":"/blog/2017/09/06/jordan-peterson-followers/","publishdate":"2017-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/09/06/jordan-peterson-followers/","section":"post","summary":"An academic psychologist is connecting left-libertarians and Trump supporters.","tags":["data","visualization","ideology","social science"],"title":"Who are Jordan Peterson’s followers?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":" **Table of Contents** {: #toc } * TOC {:toc}  Summary There is a lot of confusion about whether we’re seeing significant ideological change in the United States. With Trump and the re-appearance of white nationalism in the public spotlight, many people are wondering if conservative (right-wing) ideology is on the rise. One can find many influential outlets endorsing this notion. CBS, BBC, Vox, and certainly others have all run articles suggesting this. On the other hand, many conservatives believe that “liberal” (left-wing in America) ideology is on the rise. There are good reasons for people to be confused, because the dynamics of ideology in the United States are confusing. To help clear up some of the confusion, I’ve written this guide to some of the basics of what political scientists know about the long-term historical dynamics of ideology in the United States. And how they shed light on what is happening, or not happening, right now.\nThe rest of this post presents the key data and a little bit of my own interpretation, but here is the TLDR:\nIf there is one substantial ideological shift in American public opinion in the post-war period, it is the dramatic and near-universal increase in social liberalism since the 1950s. There has not been a general shift to the left or right because economic conservatism has not changed much (although it has polarized on the left and right). There has been some cyclical, “thermostatic” movement in opinion (which is normal). There have been changes in symbolism (“liberalism” became stigmatized in the 1960s). And there have been some dramatic shifts in party identification (a pretty massive Republican resurgence with Reagan). Otherwise, one cannot say the American public has moved to the right or left as a whole, in any significant way, in the long-run or recently, except that it has become more socially liberal. There have been some interesting and substantial ideological shifts within groups, but that would need to be another post.\nThere is currently no good evidence I am aware of that overt racism or white nationalism is growing.1 It likely appears larger than it is, especially to progressives, precisely because it has never been less common in American history. This says nothing about how such stupid and malicious groups should be dealt with.\nNot much recent change in self-identification The percentage of Americans identifying as \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; has not changed much since 1992. \u0026ldquo;Moderates\u0026rdquo; have decreased (polarization), and \u0026ldquo;liberals” have increased somewhat. This does not say very much, in large part because of the changing fortunes of the word “liberal.” See below for more on that. This small increase in “liberals” is mostly Democrats becoming more comfortable with a word that has historically been stigmatized. There is certainly no recent increase in \u0026ldquo;conservatism\u0026rdquo; here, if anything some slight shift to \u0026ldquo;liberalism.\u0026rdquo;\nIdeological Self-Identification Data from Gallup Policy Mood, 1952-2016 Policy Mood is basically an index of aggregate public support for having the government do things (see Public Opinion In America: Moods, Cycles, And Swings). It is a statistical construct made out of a large number of survey items. Aggregate policy mood tends to be cyclical, acting as a thermostat relative to the policy being supplied at the time (Wlezien 1995). The public moved somewhat to the right through the Obama years, because he was supplying leftish policies. This is a standard finding and recent years represent normal fluctuations around the historical average. Public Policy Mood Data from James Stimson Macroideology, 1937-2012 Macroideology is defined as the relative amount of self-identified liberals among self-identified liberals and conservatives.\nMacroideology Data from James Stimson “Liberalism” has decreased over time substantially since the 1960s. But that’s largely symbolic. Here’s the story as told by Ellis and Stimson (2009).\n“Liberal,” as a positive identification, was basically invented by FDR. He introduced the language over his famous fire-side chats. JFK was the last President to self-identify as a liberal. Around 1966, “liberal” became a bad word. There was a substantial and sudden decrease in identification with the word, but not such a change in underlying policy preferences. LBJ’s 89th Congress passed a lot of liberal policies, including Medicare and the voting rights bill. There was massive funding to urban areas and, let’s just say, a lot of conflict. Whatever happened, “liberalism” took a negative charge.\nMacropartisanship, 1952-2015 Macropartisanship is “the distribution of Democrats among Democratic and Republican identifiers.” Clearly around the 1980s there was a massive decrease in Democratic identification. There are a few factors at play there.\nMacropartisanship Data from James Stimson Here is how Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson in The Macro Polity(2002) summarize the dynamics of macropartisan change at that time:\n The crux of the issue is whether or not the macro and longitudinal story is fundamentally altered by knowledge of micro distinctions. In general, we would answer in the negative. It is clear that the Republican growth in the 1980s, for example, cannot be understood solely as a phenomenon of the South. Or of the male diaspora. Or the replacement of New Deal seniors with Reagan youngsters. All these factors were important, to be sure. But almost all Americans responded, for example, to the bad news of the Reagan recession and even more to the good news of the subsequent recovery, to the Iran-Contra scandal, and to the economic fortunes and misfortunes of Clinton and Bush. To find one subgroup where, for whatever reason, the response was sharper is not a convincing denial that it did not happen everywhere. Young and old, northerners and southerners, men and women all reacted to the macro-political performance of the parties, shifting their partisan dispositions to reflect success and failure.  Large, long-term increases in social liberalism On social issues such as racial equality and gender/sexuality there has been a general and long-term increase in liberalism/leftism since the 1950s. This is pretty obvious if you think about it (de-segregation, gay marriage, marijuana, etc.), but here is some data from Atkinson et al. (2011) looking at policy mood by specific issue groups.\nRacial Liberalism Data from Atkinson et al. (2011) Gender and Sexuality Liberalism Data from Atkinson et al. (2011) Even since 1999, the left and right have both become more socially liberal. Mostly among Democrats, but it’s even noticeable in Republicans if you subdivide the data (not shown here).\nIdentification with Social Liberalism Data from Gallup There is not much recent change in economic conservatism, however, which remains relatively popular in the United States.\nIdentification with Economic Liberalism (Leftism) Data from Gallup What about the far-right? Let’s start with some basic descriptive figures for the far-right today.\nOne article in The Guardian reports that a recent, national neo-Nazi summit in April brought out about 150 people. The infamous tiki-torch march by white nationalists in Charlottesville, on the evening of August 11, has been numbered around 100 people at the high end of the estimates. The larger rally, including a variety of other right-wing groups with varying ideologies, was numbered at about 500 (NPR). The Southern Poverty Law Center has the number of KKK members somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 (SPLC). One recent poll suggests about 4% of Americans ‘mostly agree’ with the white supremacy movement (Economist).\nWhat about changes over time? Here is some data from the Southern Poverty Law Center (if anything, the SPLC would should biased toward finding increases, as their raison d\u0026#39;etre is the white supremacist threat). There is no overall increase or decrease in KKK groups since 2000.\nKKK Groups Data from SPLC Some research by Leonardo Bursztyn of the University of Chicago suggests that Trump has made racists more willing to express their racism (Economist), but there’s no evidence Trump has increased the number of racists or the intensity of their racism.\nConclusion Based on all of the available data, and keeping in mind the long-term historical context, here is how I would answer the question, “Is the United States becoming more conservative or liberal (leftist)?”\nThere is no evidence that the population is becoming more conservative or leftist in general. There is strong evidence that Americans across the board have all become significantly more socially liberal since the 1950s. This has led the increasingly outnumbered, socially illiberal factions of the right-wing to find solace in the figure of Trump. Trump has coincided with an increase in the public display of social illiberalism, ranging from merely anti-PC internet trolls to organized racist groups. But there is no evidence such social illiberalism is “on the rise.”\nThe American drift toward generalized social liberalism is masked in a confusing way by changes in how Americans use the term “liberal.” There is a weird tendency, especially since the 1960s, for Americans to describe themselves as more conservative than their actual policy preferences would suggest. But the socially liberal drift is even chipping away at this stigma on the term “liberal,” as lefties are now embracing the term somewhat more.\nBut note that you can’t really say the United States has generally moved to the left in recent decades, because economic conservatism remains more popular and the changes on this front have been polarized by party. So conservatives who say the country has been taken over by lefties would be incorrect in this crucial respect.\nFinally, what about the “alt-right” and white nationalists, etc.?\nThe appearance of a recent surge in right-wing ideology, from “alt-right” internet trolls to neo-Nazi marches, is an artifact of the most socially liberal cultural consensus the United States has ever known. There is no evidence of a surge or rise in these types of ideologies. It only appears that with Trump, several strands of the socially unacceptable right-wing have moved from extremely marginalized silence, to extremely marginalized public display. The sudden appearance of a very small quantity of something that is at a historically all-time low is likely to appear as a substantial increase. But it’s not. In the case of explicitly racist white nationalism, this appears to be what is happening. None of this says anything about how such groups should be dealt with.\nIt seems fair to say that overt white racists have probably never been less numerous than they are right now. There is some risk that if Trump continues to foster this comfort among white nationalists, there could be some long-term resurgence of that ideology. But that’s only a hypothesis, and it’s not at all obvious. You could just as well hypothesize that the extreme cultural prohibition of far-right ideas has led to a long-term festering of ignorance, confusion, and resentment that is precisely what brought someone like Trump into office. You could plausibly hypothesize that letting white racists express their stupid and unconscionable viewpoints is the only real way to let them fizzle out via learning and socialization. But again, that’s only a hypothesis, too.\nThis post has refrained from polemics (mostly), but it seems appropriate to add just one point. If sane folks on the left and right did nothing more than separate their hypotheses from the data, it could make a huge, positive difference in the direction of contemporary politics.\nReferences Atkinson, M.L., Baumgartner, F.R., Coggins, K.E. and Stimson, J.A., 2011, June. “Developing policy-specific conceptions of mood: The United States.” In Annual Meeting of the Comparative Agendas Project, http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/papers/Equality-Mood-Catania-June-2011.pdf.\nEllis, Christopher, and James A.

I am not going to say it’s wrong in a dismissive footnote, because it would deserve more attention than that. But I am excluding it from consideration here for a few reasons. First, it includes a wide variety of groups well beyond explicitly racist or white nationalist groups, including black separatist groups. So in this sense it does not reflect what I am considering in this post. But also the SPLC has come under fire for being increasingly politicized and untrustworthy as a data source. See this article from Politico, for instance. My personal view is that there has been a tendency in recent years for progressive groups to lower their bar for what counts as a hate group, and at least a few cases on the SPLC’s list suggest to me this has occurred there, at least to some degree. ^   ","date":1504483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"d309629d50658e6b574f9b88577e46fd","permalink":"/blog/2017/09/04/americans-conservative-liberal-left-right/","publishdate":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/09/04/americans-conservative-liberal-left-right/","section":"post","summary":"Conservatism, racism, and white nationalism are not increasing.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about this man before watching this film. I want to make a point that requires me to give you a brief summary of the story, so here is a plot-spoiling recapitulation. Basically, after he gets rich off McAfee Antivirus, McAfee has a couple of failed business ventures before proceeding through a brazenly aggressive, daring, manipulative, controlling, arrogant, violent, and ultimately murderous course of affairs.1 After a few years as a yoga guru preaching peace and wellness from a retreat center he funded, there’s some indication that he becomes disillusioned with his efforts toward egalitarian community (he suggests something to the effect that others were taking advantage of him, but this is not examined deeply). So he buys a house in Belize, hires an idealistic biologist from the US to run an alternative medicine laboratory, recruits the toughest gangsters he can find to build an in-house private security force, donates to local police equipment worth millions of dollars, and effectively purchases several poor, local women as long-term girlfriends. When he had the time to also get two gnarly tribal tattoos was unclear to me.\nJust to round out the psychological and behavioral profile here, note that he rarely, if ever, had sex with his girlfriends; he rather liked to defecate in their mouths while lying in a hammock. When the biologist expresses concern about their business relationship, he drugs and rapes her that evening, according to the biologist’s testimony in the film. McAfee’s vicious guard dogs roamed freely on the public beach around his house, so a neighbor poisoned the dogs. Then, the film suggests, McAfee promptly hired a man to kill the neighbor. This murder allegation becomes global news, and McAfee embarks on an international fugitive escape adventure. He gets into Guatemala, where he avoids extradition back to Belize by faking a heart attack, and thereby engineering his deportation back to the United States. He then promptly runs for President in the Libertarian Party, where he comes in second place.\nNow, it is striking enough that the winner of the 2016 Presidential election is an icon of ignoring feminist ethical expectations—at a time when feminist expectations are more culturally ascendant than ever. But perhaps that was a fluke. The McAfee story is profound because it shows in stunning, horrifying detail how the hyper-masculine drive to dominate really works in contemporary culture: when cranked sufficiently high, it rapidly and easily trounces any quantity of moral outrage and/or legal constraints, in a direct line toward the zenith of the global dominance hierarchy.\nModerate misogyny can get you exiled from contemporary public culture, often for good reason, but hyper-misogyny in an intelligent and driven male appears to give you sovereignty over public culture. It seems to me that, if feminism today has one genuinely catastrophic problem to be rightfully alarmist about, it might just be the small number of males who will not be domesticated through social-moral pressure.\nFirst, a premise of my argument is that SJW culture is genuinely quite effective at minimizing the nastier masculine edges of large numbers of men, because most men are decent people who want to be liked and approved by most others. This is not an empirical article so I won’t go into it, but if you doubt there’s been a general cultural pacification of male aggression just watch a random film from the 1950s and then watch a random film at your local cinema. Anyway, people on the left and right disagree about what to call this trend, but its existence is attested by all. Feminists see this as men learning to be less violent and oppressive, and feminists celebrate women’s long-term positive effect on the civilizing of violent patriarchies; others see this as a kind of female totalitarianism and evidence of civilizational decline. But the fact that feminist cultural politics have exerted notable and widespread effects of generally reducing the expression of masculine aggression in public culture seems hard to dispute.\nThe hypothesis I would like to advance is that this social domestication of masculine tendencies has made our society more vulnerable to the rare cases of men who escape the filter of social opprobrium. The life of John McAfee is a case study of this problem.\nWhy would the social pacification of once popular, moderate masculinity empower more virulent forms of violent masculinity? Many lefties think that pacifying the larger mass of men will shift the whole distribution of male behavior, lowering the ceiling of how bad the worst men may become. I would say this is the dominant mental model of most SJWs, because it’s the basic picture that comes out of liberal arts education today (that our images of the world shape what we do in the world, hence the emphasis on media and “representations”).\nThe problem is that when the baseline of masculine dominance expression is held below it\u0026rsquo;s organic tendency, defined simply as what men would do in the absence of cultural campaigns to defang it, this increases the potential payoff to those who dare exercise it, as there are more resources to dominate precisely to the degree that other men are not contesting them. Not only does it increase the rewards available, it decreases the risk of competing for them, as the chance of being defeated by an equally aggressive male, or even just the chance of encountering costly competition at all, is lower than it would be in a world of much but minor, local masculine excess. We might also adduce a “rusty monitor” effect: Through the domestication of men over time, most people become blissfully forgetful about what genuinely dangerous men are capable of, decreasing the probability or the speed with which domesticated males might awake from their slumber.\nAnother reason the over-domestication of moderate masculinity is dangerous is that it makes it too easy for ethically lax “bad characters” to win all of the large number of local hierarchies that would typically have the function of imposing humility and modesty on cocky boys coming of age. If you’re a highly intelligent, confident, and driven young man, the complex difficulty of having to navigate multiple distinct local hierarchies (among other highly driven males themselves sometimes prone to dangerous excess) from a young age, teaches you very quickly that you cannot ever be the best at everything. And that if you cut corners anti-socially you will be destroyed by other males invested in the maintenance of sociality. Examples of local hierarchies are sports competition, dating, ethical honor or “character” in the neighborhood or religious community, or even just fleeting micro-social competition such as battles of wits in social gatherings. All of these things will function as negative feedback mechanisms tempering genuinely dangerous anti-social ambitions in young boys coming of age, but only if the other males are equally able and willing to play all of these games to the best of their abilities.\nIf you’re overzealous or immodest or you cheat or you ignore your standing in one local hierarchy to dominate another—all of these things tend to get constrained by other males of equal will and ability, who are also sometimes dangerous and who have an interest in knocking all wiley characters down a few notches. What’s happened in recent decades is that a non-trivial portion of the West’s most intelligent and ambitious males pursue cultural careers predicated very specifically on the strategic under-display of their will to power. Take someone like the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau—he’s the leading politician of a whole country, so nobody can deny that this is a man with a substantial will to rise to the top through a whole series of competitive filters. But he is one of the best examples of how, today, the path to power for all “decent men” consists in a deeply deceptive competition to appear maximally unthreatening. One reason you get the John McAfee’s of the world is because they went to high school with the Justin Trudeau’s of the world. In all of the little, local hierarchies they encountered throughout life, people like John McAfee and Donald Trump learned that they could be as anti-socially ambitious as they pleased and no other intelligent and able men would check them (because those men were opting for the cultural capital that accrues to being feminist). A serious challenge for feminism is to see that someone like Justin Trudeau is seriously complicit in the production of the McAfees and Trumps of the world. And if your a cheer-leader for the former, you’re an objective supporter and producer of the latter.\nI also think that people like McAfee and Trump learn early in life that if you are ostracized from social groups for exceeding moral expectations, then you can just channel your anti-social intelligence to making money all the more efficiently. That is, another key problem is that in secular, advanced capitalist countries such as the U.S., if you are smart and driven enough it is a feasible life path to accept absolute social exile by converting all of your energy into economic capital accumulation, and then build up a new social cosmos for yourself. The interesting thing is to see that this is really only psychologically and materially feasible in a very late stage of advanced western capitalism where non-economic criteria of value have all but disappeared. Whereas above we saw one reason for the emergence of the McAfee’s and Trump’s of the world is that there wasn’t enough local masculine aggression to check them throughout their life, here we note the specific problem that secular society lacks any effective adjudicator of human character other than economic prowess. In this particular dimension we see that the contemporary correlation of anti-capitalism and secularism/atheism is ultimately an untenable loop, because you never have an effective basis for anti-capitalist cultural change if you cannot submit to the possibility that values come from a place higher than practical reality. Of course people pretend they value other criteria, but those criteria don’t operate in the selection of who ultimately wins attention, esteem, and power in society as a whole. There was no person, and no entity, in the entire life of these men who could credibly convey that there exist things in life more powerful than money, for the simple reason that hardly anyone believes this anymore. And so the most toxically ambitious males become the very first to realize that one can very well quit the entire game of socio-moral respectability and shoot to the top of everything via radically unreflective capital accumulation.\nAnother reason why the constraining of moderate masculine toxicity may increase the power of supertoxic masculinity is that males may become more pathologically power hungry from lacking opportunities for healthy satiation. Once upon a time (for better or worse), masculine prowess promised a fair number of immediate satisfactions. The best football players received the genuine interest of the most desired girls in high school, say. But even from my own observations growing up, it was easy to see that as my cohort aged from about 10 years old up toward about 17 years old, conventionally masculine prowess became less and less effective at winning immediate social rewards. By the end of high school, the most desired girls were more interested in—I kid you not—a nationally competitive business role-playing team. What this suggests to me is that, aside from perhaps an early bump at the very beginning of adolescence, dominance hierarchies rapidly stop rewarding conventional masculine expressions of dominance behavior in favor of the capacity to elegantly dissimulate dominance behavior. Today all of the basic evolutionary machinery of mating and dominance competition remains in full operation, but it’s mind-bogglingly confusing because increasingly females select for males who can most creatively and effectively hide their power. What this means is that precisely the most over-flowingly aggressive males may be less and less likely to receive the basic, small doses of love and esteem that every human being requires, in their early socialization experiences. Combined with the previous point about the ultimate power of money, it’s easy to see how and why the feminist inversion of which males get selected by females (defining dominance as the dissimulation of dominance), has the direct consequence of leaving the most irrepressibly narcissistic and power-hungry males to seek unbridled social domination via capital, as a basic requirement for psychological self-maintenance.\nJohn McAfee and Donald Trump are the types of whom it can be said, literally, that they are capable of making the entire world conform to their whims. They can do this repeatedly and sustainably, even when a large number of interested opponents see what they are doing, even when it publicized to the moral outrage of the entire respectable, cosmopolitan world. What is genuinely frightening and dangerous about powerful males is precisely that their power is real, i.e. absolutely impervious to the wishes, interests, and indignant words of less powerful people.\nIt seems to me that, broadly, there are two possible ways to dealing with this problem. The method popular activist culture has adopted is to work toward a state of zero dominance expression in all possible local and global hierarchies, with this leading to a substantially higher risk of psychopathic males going straight to the top of the megamachine, for all of the reasons I’ve laid out. Now, to be fair, I see one way you might still find this method preferable: if you believe that psychopathic male drives for dominance could possibly be socialized out of our biology altogether in some kind of long-term evolutionary engineering process. If that’s your model, then I suppose you could defend the now popular approach as a risky but radical plan to eliminate violence forever, or something like that. Personally, I find that hard to believe, but that would require a different essay. In the meantime, I suppose we all have to make our wagers as we see fit.\nOf course, the second solution is simply to permit or even encourage small amounts of masculine dominance behavior in a large number of local hierarchies (with some margin greater than zero for dangerous excesses), leading to a low likelihood of psychopathic males rising to the top of the megamachine.\nA final point about the role of higher education in all of this. In a contemporary liberal arts education, the primary educational experience is coming to feel the power of words. This is a real and important insight because in modern societies the symbolic order exerts extraordinary if diffuse effects, and I benefitted from gaining this kind of awareness in my own liberal arts education. This feeling is also exciting and empowering because we all have the capacity to produce words. But for this reason—combined with the fact that direct violence in wealthy Western societies is atypically low in long-run historical perspective—a very large number of well-meaning lefty folks today have genuinely forgotten that there exist forces more powerful than words. We have forgotten that the whole, horrifying, tragic, and very real problem of power is precisely that those who have enough of it may ultimately do exactly what they please. Many lefties today seem to be living on the genuine belief that enough people, saying enough words, is a viable method for constraining anything whatsoever. It’s not.\nThe McAfee documentary is an extraordinary lesson of how no amount of moralizing can solve the fact that unequal distributions of raw human power exist across society; no amount of \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; or information-sharing or even law-making will ever be able to stop the will to power wherever it sneaks through the cracks of social inhibition. One of morality’s dirtiest and most harmful little secrets is that it only constrains power where power is already weak for other reasons. Contemporary SJW-styled feminism will make the large mass of beta bro’s marginally more polite. It may, for short- to medium-term intervals, suppress the brutality of alpha types who may indeed be prone to some abusive behaviors. But it will also ensure that wherever the male will to dominance arises in it purest form, it will wreak more havoc, more rapidly, more unpredictably, more completely, and at a higher socio-political level than it ever could have without feminist “moral progress.”\n Of course, I am assuming the film’s narrative is to be trusted. I haven’t fact-checked anything. Whether the film is perfectly accurate or fair is probably not crucial for the larger point I will make here. ^   ","date":1499904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"92abb9e170fb1982fc5c3fa7f7c45011","permalink":"/blog/2017/07/13/supertoxic-masculinity/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/07/13/supertoxic-masculinity/","section":"post","summary":"A serious feminist challenge is what to do with hyper-dominant males who are not domesticated by any amount of moral or legal constraint; in fact, excessive social constraints on average males may help explain why supertoxic masculinity is now a fast-track to the heights of political power.","tags":["radical politics","gender","violence","activism"],"title":"Feminism and the problem of supertoxic masculinity","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"It once made sense for professional intellectuals to bite their tongue in exchange for the influence they could gain by conforming to the dominant language. For a while, this was arguably rational and defensible—perhaps even a game-theoretic necessity for anyone sincerely interested in cultivating a genuinely public and political intellectual project. While it’s obvious the internet has changed the game, old stereotypes die hard and continue to constrain human potential well after their objective basis has disappeared. In particular, the contemporary stereotype of the public intellectual as a self-possessed professional who regularly appears in “the media” to speak on public affairs in the royal language, is a contingent product of the postwar rise of mass broadcasting (one-to-many) media. In much of the postwar period, the classic “mass media”—newspapers, radio, television—had extremely large, mass audiences and where characterized by high costs of entry. This technical and economic environment offered huge rewards for speaking the dominant language within the paramaters of respectable opinion. It was probably with cable television that a centrifugal tendency began the processes of fragmentation, polarization, and decentralization that would eventually bring us to where we are today.\nToday, there is no longer any mass audience to speak to through dominant channels, overwhelming majorities do not trust mass media, and even the cognitively fragmented semi-mass audiences that remain will only listen to what they already think. Not to mention the masses probably have less power today than anytime in the twentieth century, so why bother even trying to speak to the masses? As a young academic, if I play by the rules for the next 10 years so that I might be respected by influential academics or gain access to regularly speaking on BBC or something like that, I would have sacrificed all of my creative energy for quite nearly nothing. As far as I can tell, today, the idea of biding your time as a young and respectable intellectual, to one day earn a platform of political significance, appears finally and fully obsolete. In one sense, this is already obvious to the millions who long ago stopped following mainstream media and long ago lost all respect for academic credentials; but in another sense, an overwhelming number of human beings continue to think, speak, and behave as if we are still operating in this old world, as if there is some reason to not say everything one feels like saying, as if there is some social or political or economic reward that will come toward the end of a respectable career of professional self-restraint. It’s easy for autodidacts and natural outsiders to say, “Duh, we told you so,” but this in no way comprehends or solves the really striking and politically significant puzzle that an extraordinary degree of human power remains voluntarily repressed for rewards and punishments that no longer exist.\nJust as the self-restrained professional intellectual is shaped by the rewards of a media environment long dead, so too are they shaped by punishments which are little more than paranoid fears. Many academics and professionals believe that for the sake of their careers they must exercise the utmost discretion in what they put online, and they confidently tell young people to exercise the same discretion for the sake of their own futures. But the reality is almost the exact opposite. First of all, with some important exceptions of course, nobody gives a shit about what you put on the internet. Nobody with any power over you has the time to follow, and the few that do won’t care enough about you to follow or dig very much. In my now slightly above-average history of recklessly posting to the internet, before and after getting a competitive professional job, the worst that has ever happened is that nobody cares (and that’s most of the time). But the best that has happened, here and there, is that a lot of people care and appreciate it and new friends are made and all kinds of new paths appear, individually and collectively.\nThe self-restraining, strategic professional intellectual is not only operating on incorrect beliefs but beliefs which are almost exactly inverse to the truth: today, playing by rules of respectability is perhaps the straightest path to unemployment and impotent resentment, while simply cultivating the capacity to say or do something real (by definition prohibited by respectability), is a necessary (and sometimes even sufficient) condition for being genuinely valued by anyone, anywhere. Obviously if you have certain dimensions of poor character (i.e. you’re a racist or something) then reckless posting to the internet will likely, and perhaps rightly, lead to many negative consequences. But if you’re a basically decent person who just wants to push a little harder on what you really think, what you really feel, your experiences or your interests, or even just fuck around, the conventional wisdom still drastically overestimates the punishments and underestimates the rewards of doing so.\nIf these comments feel to you outdated because you think all of this already happened years ago with the initial rise of the internet, I would say you underestimate the quantity of human beings (and the qualitative intensities they could produce), who have yet to fully update their beliefs and behaviors around these matters. In some sense, the United States only just now, in 2016, elected its first President of the internet age. The fact that millions of people are genuinely perplexed and horrified by what is happening in this regard, is an index of how little the internet’s rewiring of power circuits has actually been integrated in the perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors of most people.\nIf political theory will ever be a world-historical causal factor in the radically fragmented and decentralized age of information, I believe it will at least partially have to consist in living, interpersonal transmissions of what works to produce power within concrete, available situations. I suppose it is on that belief that I am reflecting on matters such as the micro-politics of self-expression, with some personal context as anecdotal data. I believe there exist objective, micro-political mechanisms whereby being real generates real power; that many people under-estimate or mistrust the objective reality of this mechanism; that many people live under compliant resentment because of incorrect beliefs about how the macro-social institutional environment will respond to their idiosyncratic deviations.\nIf I speak about myself at all, it’s not because I’m special or great but precisely because I am nothing, nobody, yet it has always been in learning how to become nobody that I seem to unlock whatever few real powers now possess me. I’m a young nobody academic or writer or whatever, I’m not famous or influential in academia or even on the internet, but I have been able to cultivate and maintain an energetic, autonomous, creative intellectual life that feels to me on the right track intellectually and politically, by what I think is a more accurate but still uncommon map of our immediate strategic environment, combined with periodically forcing myself to push outward on what feels to be in some way not allowed.\nI have almost come to see this as a methodological principle—wherever you genuinely think or observe or desire to do something that you would be vaguely punished socially for saying/doing at a dinner party, then saying/doing that on the internet almost always produces immanent power and its by-product joy; it almost always clears debilitating noise and advances one of the threads that make-up the continiuty of one’s life. The entire life orientation that believes facing toward power is the image of intellectual and political sophistication—this, in my view, is the spitting image of mystified contemporary complicity. If I am trying to share how I think all of this works, and how I have experienced it, it is because I dream of what would happen if thousands of highly capable intellects currently toiling under institutional respectability suddenly realized they have no reason to self-censor and everything to gain from simply disarming their objectively miscalibrated expression calculators.\n","date":1497916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"4177cede1f5f161ad9da044fdb2f8b70","permalink":"/blog/2017/06/20/the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/","publishdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/06/20/the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/","section":"post","summary":"Why real nobodies are more powerful than repressed somebodies (the internet epoch has hardly begun).","tags":["mechanisms","technology","media","emotions"],"title":"The affective politics of keeping it real","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"Why do so many respectable, intellectually oriented people (academics, artists, and activists) wish to exclude independent right-wing intellectual work on moral grounds? I have in mind several recent campaigns to ensure some right-wing writer/artist, not be allowed to speak or perform in some venue. I am going to make a general theoretical point about a widespread social phenomenon, but I should also be honest about the specific individuals and institutions I see as motivating case studies. I have in mind the campaign to shut down the LD50 gallery, and the decision of The New Centre for Research \u0026amp; Practice to remove Nick Land from its roster of lecturers. I don\u0026rsquo;t know these people, and I have nothing against them personally. I have no interest in impugning them or \u0026ldquo;calling them out,\u0026rdquo; I would much rather enjoy thinking with them; the problem is that these are precisely cases of closing that door, on \u0026ldquo;progressive\u0026rdquo; grounds that appear dishonest, cowardly, and conservative. So although I have no ill will, the only way to think about door-closers is from the outside of their door, e.g. about them, rather than with them. These campaigns and institutional decisions, and so many public pronouncements by other “progressive” actors, present themselves as efforts to protect the public sphere from violent or harmful effects, but it’s increasingly impossible to believe that this is the real motivation. There is a widespread fallacy, what we might call the ad hominem fallacy fallacy, that it’s unreasonable to question someone’s motivations. It may be unreasonable to dismiss someone’s arguments by impugning their motivations, but it’s very reasonable to theorize someone’s motivations as on object of interest in its own right—especially when the stated motivations are increasingly belied by the effects they repeatedly produce.\nI want to offer a concrete, informal theoretical account of what institutional intellectuals are really doing when they pull-up their draw-bridges to independent right-wing intellectuals such as Nick Land. Very simply, they are imposing a cordon sanitaire that is instrumentally necessary to the continuation of their unjustified intellectual privileges in the institutional order. I am increasingly convinced there is simply no other public function to this political repetition compulsion. The reason this is important, from the left, is that this cordon sanitaire is straightforwardly a mechanism to conserve the status quo, everything progressives pretend to be interested in overthrowing. This is why neo-reactionary intellectuals speak of the status quo political order as dominated by a left-progressive “Cathedral,” and this post will provide one example of why I think they are correct to do so. In this way, genuine left revolutionaries will sooner than later learn to take heed from some of these right-wing diagnoses about what is rotten in left culture. If you believe in radical equality and collective liberation from unjust institutions, from the left, you have to be able to see how your compulsions might be a function of this Cathedral more than you care to admit. As someone who currently possesses bourgeois intellectual privileges, and as someone who believes in equality (i.e., I know I am not ultimately superior to many others who lack my platform), I wish to be perfectly clear about how these mechanisms function, as someone who bears witness to them introspectively. If it is still possible to be a genuinely radical intellectual committed to collective liberation, this is the least it will require.\nFirst, it seems to be a fact that the genuinely intellectual wings of the alt-right or neo-reaction (NRx) or whatever you want to call it, are probably too intelligent and sophisticated for bourgeois intellectual workers to engage with, let alone compete with. The reason I know this is because I have only been able to really explore this world with the privilege of my sabbatical; bourgeois intellectual workers typically just don’t have the time to read a bunch of long essays on the internet. So if those essays are actually pretty smart and a legitimate challenge to your institutional authority as a credentialed intellectual—you are functionally required to close ranks, if only with a silent agreement to not engage. As an academic political scientist, I have at least average comfort with the history of political thought, yet when I really peruse all the independent NRx intellectuals, if I’m being honest I’d have to admit that I would need to go back to the books to really grok and engage what some of them are trying to say. I am on research leave and I don’t even have the time (or interest) in really doing that as deeply as would be required to engage all of it meaningfully. This is how I can very confidently call bullshit on any currently full-time bourgeois symbol-manipulator who pretends to know with any confidence the alleged uselessness or harmfulness of the NRx intellectual ecology.\nNow, as soon as anyone from this non-institutional world produces effects within the institutional orbit, it is actually a really serious survival reflex for all institutionally privileged intellectuals to play the morality card (“no platform!”). If all these strange, outside autodidacts are actually smart and independently producing high-level intellectual content you don’t have the time to even understand, let alone defeat or otherwise control, this is an existential threat to your entire livelihood. Because all of your personal identity, your status, and your salary, is based directly on your credentialed, legitimated membership card giving your writings and pontifications an officially sanctioned power and authority. If that door is opened even a crack by non-credentialed outsiders, the whole jig is up for the respectable bourgeois monopoly on the official intellectual organs of society.\nAn interesting question is, because respectable intellectuals are often pretty smart and capable, why are they so fearful of outside intellectual projects, even if they are as evil as some fear? They are smart and capable intellectuals, so you’d think they would embrace some interesting challenge as an opportunity for productive contestation. Why don’t they? Well, here’s where the reality gets ugly. The reason respectable intellectuals so instinctively close ranks around the moral exclusion of NRx intellectuals is that currently working, respectable intellectuals privately know that the intellectual compromises they have made to secure their respectability and careers has rendered most of their life’s work sadly and vulnerably low-quality.\nTo convince status-quo cultural money dispensers to give you a grant, for instance, any currently “successful” academic or artist has to so extensively pepper their proposal with patently stupid words and notions that knowingly make the final result a sad, contorted piece of work 80% of which is bent to the flattery of our overlords. But we falsely rationalize this contortion as “mature discipline” which we then rationalize to be the warrant for our privileged status as legitimate intellectuals. This is just good old fashioned conservatism, the standard psychology of bourgeois hypocrisy that is the molecular basis for the stability of a capitalist society organized around unjust and unequal exploitation.\nBecause we know deep down inside that our life’s work is only half of what it could have been had we the courage to not ask for permission, if there ever arise people who are doing high-level intellectual work on the outside, exactly as they wish to without anyone’s permission or money, then not only are we naturally resentful, but we secretly know that at least some of these outsiders are likely doing more interesting, more valuable, more radically incisive work than we are, because we secretly know that we earn our salary by agreeing to only say half of what we could.\n(Aside: The only reason I’m psychologically and sociologically capable of writing this is precisely because through the internet I am shifting a large share of my eggs into the basket of the outside, instead of writing grant bids that actively make me less interesting and less honest; and I am young enough in my academic career that my sunk costs and interpersonal investments in academic networks are sufficiently low that I can admit these realities without too much pain.)\nBecause the entire social value and self-esteem of respectable intellectuals is premised on this guilty conscience, moral opposition is the most immediately natural and useful symbolic flagpole around which a cordon sanitaire will rapidly and spontaneously be constructed and defended. In this natural and obvious urgency, bad faith will occasionally out itself in slips of the tongue whereby academics, such as a one David Golumbia, proudly and explicitly reveal their commitment to anti-intellectual tactics. You might think that rallying around such a patently unintellectual position typically associated with bourgeois-conservative simpletons would itself be avoided as an existential threat just as well, for it loudly publicizes a scandalous dearth of the very intellectual firepower on which our status and salaries are supposed to depend. That respectable bourgeois intellectual culture would seek to stave off one existential threat through the symbolic equivalent of a kamikaze gambit reflects a secret awareness of its own doomed nature.\n","date":1494806400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"868f6ffea1e16b411b6665caa49c5d8a","permalink":"/blog/2017/05/15/psychology-of-prohibiting-outside-thinkers/","publishdate":"2017-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/05/15/psychology-of-prohibiting-outside-thinkers/","section":"post","summary":"The real motivation of respectable progressivism is managing guilty conscience and conserving bourgeois privileges; how to theorize the Cathedral from the revolutionary left; understanding the suicide bombing of anti-intellectual intellectuals.","tags":["academia","activism","mechanisms","radical politics"],"title":"The psychology of prohibiting outside thinkers","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"As knowledge has become so specialized, many people would rather ignore or criticize highly evolved specialist discourses rather than admit they simply cannot understand them. This allows specialists to emerge as genuine masters who come to dominate others through this particular dimension of objective superiority, whereas honest admissions of ignorance and uncertainty would be an empirically and normatively sophisticated basis for unifying the large mass of normal people into a living project transcending capitalism (i.e. mass movement). The crucial political insight here is that self-aware stupidity is far more scientifically correct and powerful than misleading performances of intelligence. The overwhelming majority of public performances of intelligence understate the significant uncertainty around even most true claims, as this brings material and psychological rewards, and little cost to the individual, especially as social media allow us to mute opposition. But when we all pretend we’re equally up to speed on the objective dynamics characterizing contemporary society, this simulation enforces and obfuscates the unfair distribution of intellectual legitimacy based on cultural capital.\nWe either attune to the disinterested objective truths of being or else the vicissitudes of capital attune us to an infinite future of hell. Insist upon the ultimate human equality of our ultimately shared, cosmic worthlessness (you are welcome to call this dignity, but you’d have to believe in god). Otherwise, feigning equality where it does not exist will always be a servomechanism of capital. It is a tactic of cultural capital accumulation through brute force, which is not excused by its being also weak and unsuccessful. The reality we have to process is that the hierarchy of intellectual command today is not a gradually distributed pyramid (an image that incorrectly flatters most people by suggesting they are only a little below the top while also being above many others). It is better visualized as one small group in a hot-air balloon, with computers drilled into their skulls, drifting away from almost everybody existing, all of whom are equally lost, confused, and helpless. As I will try to show, this is not sad but rather an ecstatic realization.\nAn activist who sounds convincing in a meeting might be 90% wrong about how the world works, but they are convincing simply because within their milieu they have an above average stock of cultural capital (verbal fluidity, education, seniority, etc.). The problem is not that this is “unfair” or “counterproductive” (common euphemisms), the problem is far more drastic: in a frighteningly literal way, that activist is a flesh-robot programmed and installed by capital, to serve the overall stability and growth of a system in which capital is the only possible adjudicator. By under-reporting our honest ignorance and uncertainty, we misleadingly command from others a kind of pathetic, sterile respect rooted in little more than their own comparatively worse illnesses, whereas an honest reporting of our own helpless stupidity is generative of energies for collective search (“most people are as stupid as I am, so my chance of figuring out what to do is as good as anyone else’s”); sincere irreverence and non-conformity leading to the breakdown of bourgeois repression (“all these people who want me to be a normal servomechanism of capital are dumb and powerless”); an increase in risk-tolerance through a decrease in false hope (“I used to be cautious because I thought I had a chance of surviving, but now that I see none of us will survive at present, I might as well try to do something I find interesting, which, ironically, makes me feel like maybe there is a chance…).” If we all admitted that, compared to specialists, most people are equal in their absolute incompetence, we might just be able to do something they can’t.\nRemember those human-computers I asked you to imagine floating off into outer space, leaving us behind? If such cyborg intelligences designed the optimal virus to ensure the spread of capitalism, and then released it upon the earth, it would have to look eerily like the modern left-wing project: an exploitative drive to symbolically out-exploit the dominant exploiters, which convincingly presents itself as opposition to exploitation, not only spreading the culture of exploitation but super-charging it, as the competitive proliferation of obfuscation reaches a density that no human being could possibly penetrate in one lifetime. Not to mention that the already dominant exploiters also possess economies of scale in the production of obfuscation, dooming the left to lose even at the level of moral one-upmanship. It is the left that initiates an arms race of increasing stupidity, on top of the arms race of exploitation, without in any way decreasing the spread or intensity of exploitation, indeed pushing it deeper and deeper into instinctual intersubjective dynamics (the soul). If capitalism is a series of injuries inflicted on the weak, the history of anti-capitalism hitherto is a series of insults added to each injury, sold to the injured as preventative medicine.\nTo speak of left-wing activists as possessed by a capitalist virus sent here by a super-intelligence from the future might sound like science fiction, but hasn’t the average perspective always rejected radical political theory as science fiction? That this diagnosis will sound to many like science fiction becomes objective data that it might just be correct, an authentic realization about how the world works and what is happening, beyond what is conceivable within the ideological boundaries of what is defined as reasonable. I believe the inevitable next move of any coherent revolutionary anti-capitalism will be to accept this as an objective characterization of our history on this planet, and to update our beliefs and activities accordingly. Ultimately, only time will tell.\nAt first, these realizations may be depressing, but depressingly true realizations are the price of entry to the ecstasy of moving from lost to found. When the lost find themselves in the radical equality of honest and absolute helplessness, my hypothesis is that we will be uniquely capable of moves that are psychologically and sociologically prohibited to those who currently command their specialized sectors of the global cybernetic apparatus. Ultimately, they are the most enslaved by this system, that’s why the system selected and promoted them. We are those who were unfit to be slaves of this system (anyone silly enough to still be reading this blog post on the internet is, by definition, included in this “we”), that’s why we are being left to rot at the bottom of its garbage disposal. But one of the primary reasons this is so oppressive is simply because we are obsessed with the excruciating and exhausting work of pretending the situation is otherwise. For those willing to acknowledge where they really are, new and unexpected winds begin to blow, the room to maneuver suddenly appears tremendous, and communication once again becomes possible, as if for the first time.\nIt is only the fearful and defensive will to decelerate that makes acceleration so brutal and insufferable; genuine submission to unconditional acceleration appears the only pathway to a sensible and durable calm, if only the white noise of unbiased chaos. Nothing about this prohibits creative, collective emancipatory projects to establish equal freedom and abundance for all, after the acceptance and integration of objective realities.\n","date":1493683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"df46f3a33533c69fb928bd659dd48374","permalink":"/blog/2017/05/02/activism-is-a-virus/","publishdate":"2017-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/05/02/activism-is-a-virus/","section":"post","summary":"Capitalism is horrible because it disposes humans as cosmic garbage, but the only motor of that garbage disposal is rabid denial.","tags":["radical politics","liberation","activism","ideology"],"title":"Activism is a capitalist virus from the future (honesty is stage-one cybernetic communism)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"Nick Land sometimes reads Deleuze and Guattari as if all the mechanisms theorized by them are mechanisms unique to capitalism. I’m going to argue that this is one of the many specific points in which the accelerationist question remains far from settled, and in which the foreclosing of revolutionary praxis strikes me as over-hasty.\nTo Land, some of D\u0026amp;G’s concepts are not just theoretically applicable to features of capitalism but strictly synonymous with them:\n The D\u0026amp;G model of capitalism is not dialectical, but cybernetic, defined by a positive coupling of commercialization (“decoding”) and industrialization (“Deterritorialization”), intrinsically tending to an extreme (or “absolute limit”). Capitalism is the singular historical installation of a social machine based upon cybernetic escalation (positive feedback), reproducing itself only incidentally, as an accident of continuous socio-industrial revolution. Nothing brought to bear against capitalism can compare to the intrinsic antagonism it directs towards its own actuality, as it speeds out of itself, hurtling to the end already operative ‘within’ it. (Of course, this is madness.)”\n This is reasonable enough because capitalism certainly provides the most stunning and historically consequential examples of these mechanisms. But this is effectively a form of selection bias. This thing we call capitalism is only the contingent world-historical catastrophe that has made us conscious of these mechanisms through our feeling the violent long-run effects of them having over-taken us.\nThe whole point of D\u0026amp;G’s project, in my view, is to identify very general mechanisms; such that they can serviceably explain the perpetuation of systemic oppressions but also serve as actionable maps for spinning new, non-linear systemic dynamics (world-historical transitions) from the most micro-scopic mechanisms. If “decoding” meant “commercialization,” why are their texts otherwise quite clearly anti-capitalist? In other words, while I think these readings of D\u0026amp;G are often quite brilliant and productive, the current frontiers of accelerationism have something of a problem around “face validity.”\nI think the biographical evidence makes it very hard to fathom that D or G intended any kind of passive capitulationism, and their works are a brilliant catalogue of calls to activity. Their writings are filled with injunctions such as, “Always follow the rhizome by rupture; lengthen, prolong, and relay the line of flight,” etc. Am I really to imagine that all of these lines are trying to tell me that I should start a business? I am not dismissing the provocative capitalist reading of D\u0026amp;G, I am only pointing out the obvious (which is surprisingly glossed over by the current frontiers of accelerationsim): D\u0026amp;G’s call to accelerate seemed pretty clearly to be part of a larger vision in which any interested party could learn how to accelerate into liberation from the inertia of systemic oppression; that the other side is more desirable, and that we might even find each other there together.\nI am not saying that the passivism or “horrorism” of Landian or unconditional accelerationism (i.e., there’s basically nothing for us to do) is not possibly the correct, final conclusion that D\u0026amp;G were simply incapable of drawing; it is only to say that, insofar as accelerationism is premised on D\u0026amp;G, passivist interpretations should explain why D\u0026amp;G spent so much effort delineating all of those general mechanisms in a general way, with so many inspiriting exhortations, if not to use them for liberatory ends.\nMany want to conclude that the call to accelerate forecloses revolutionary praxis, but one of the seminal projects underwriting the accelerationist turn, that of D\u0026amp;G, is filled with micro-models of how to produce macro-phenomena. Accelerating, in my view, means actively pursuing these threads, only faster. I do not see any strong reasons why, in D\u0026amp;G, the call to accelerate must necessarily imply a sharp exit from the project of fundamentally changing the world through revolutionary action—unless you define D\u0026amp;G’s concepts as essentially beginning and ending with capitalism. And I see no reason for doing that, other than a selection bias in which we are overweighting the reality of capitalism simply because it’s the phenomenon through which we first saw certain general mechanisms to work on planetary scale.\n","date":1493337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"15d2c4b3d1b868c1097590ce5f24e1f7","permalink":"/blog/2017/04/28/capitalism-is-an-instance/","publishdate":"2017-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/04/28/capitalism-is-an-instance/","section":"post","summary":"On Deleuze and Guattari, cosmic selection bias, and the room for revolutionary praxis despite unconditional acceleration.","tags":["radical politics","social science","mechanisms","Deleuze","Guattari","Nick Land","accelerationism"],"title":"Capitalism is an instance, not an essence","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":" People who want to think, write, or act outside of what is perceived as normal within currently consituted left-wing circles are now commonly talked about as possible fascist sympathizers. Typically, if you drill down into what is being said exactly, they are not accused of being fascists, they are accused of not clearly enough differentiating themselves from fascism, to a degree that exceeds the currently established expectations of what anti-fascism is believed to look like. When you drill down, the root of the problem (and sometimes admittedly) is reputation: “I know you’re not a fascist but these other people will wonder, ergo I must disavow you as inadequately anti-fascist.”\nThe problem is that this model of changing the culture is premised on the willful acceptance and promotion of incorrect judgments. Contemporary left culture is premised on the belief that you can change the world through noble mistakes. But as a rule, you cannot change the world for the better by agreeing to make mistakes. You will either fail to change anything because you are operating in a fantasy land, or you will make the world much worse as you try to forcibly deform it around your mistakes. There is no such thing as a noble error. Every error or mistaken judgment that is tolerated or promoted in left culture as “solidarity,” will directly and demonstrably lead to a decreased probability of achieving equality and freedom.\nAs I have tried to make this argument in the past but typically to closed ears, the purpose of this post is to demonstrate the problem in the clearest, most demonstrable and undeniable fashion, using some basic concepts from my background as a social scientist. Basically, the issue is that for human beings errors are unavoidable, but there are different types of errors and whether we like it or not we make choices about which types of errors we are more or less willing to accept before acting on a judgment. Even more usefully, we can generate some predictions about future outcomes based on which types of errors we decide to be comfortable with. Currently, left culture is deeply invested in reducing one type of error while it is almost infinitely comfortable with a different type of error. As I try to show below, the only possible result is that membership in the organized radical left must ultimately drop to zero, a process I believe is currently underway. I am also able to generate some predictions about the temporal shape of this extinction event that I fear is currently underway. I believe that soon this post will not even be necessary, as the predicted outcomes I outline below come true; but as these outcomes have not yet fully arrived, it is my wager that posts such as this might be enough to make the currently doomed strategies collapse once and for all.\nI will focus on the particular example of anti-fascism because it offers an attractively simple and well-known structure of left/right group differentiation. But everything I say here can be applied to a variety of attitudes and behaviors dominant in left culture.\nTwo different types of error and the example of anti-fascism Scientists distinguish between Type 1 errors (false positives, you think something exists when it really doesn’t) and Type 2 errors (false negatives, you think something is not there when it really is). If you are one of those people who genuinely believe there is no objective reality outside of our interpretations of it, buckle up.\nWhenever we are confronted with a question about something in the world, there is some risk of both types of error. If you maybe just saw a snake in the bush, there is some probability you are right and some probability you are wrong. And you have to decide what to do, so what’s at stake here is not some obscure scientific theory: I am talking about basic unavoidable challenges of being a human. We can either do them intelligently and act on the world effectively (dodge snakes when they are there and relax when they are not there), or we can pretend we don’t have to grapple with them and basically sign-up to be helpless victims of our environment (never really run and never really relax, but just accept you’re probably going to get eaten by a python eventually so whatever).\nThis scenario is exactly analogous to the problem of anti-fascism. If there is someone in our movement for collective equality who is actually sympathetic to fascism or likely to say/do things that help fascism, then we probably won’t want to work with them. This is reasonable enough, and it is widely seen as a serious and urgent issue. But there is also another problem, which is symptomatically not discussed as very urgent or serious, which is that you will sometimes incorrectly refuse to work with someone who actually, on net, would help your team get to where it’s trying to go. People on the left like to act like this is not a genuine problem of judgment; it’s just how things are, there are norms, if someone wants to break those norms, then they can’t work with left groups, “it’s not up to me.” But that’s what Sartre called bad faith. It is up to you, it’s unavoidably up to everyone in the struggle for political change to decide who you will and who you will not work with. Everyone on the radical left has to make individual and group judgments that carry an unavoidable risk of being false, either failing to eject forces of harm or ejecting forces of good. You can also easily see how this basic structure is observed in many other particular questions of how to conduct ourselves in trying to produce social change.\nSo we think we might have seen a snake—we think someone in our groups will do more harm to our project than good—but we can’t know for sure. The idea that person X is basically good and would be a net contributor to collective liberation if we worked togetehr, we will call that the “null hypothesis” (usually denoted H0). The idea that person X would be a net detractor of the project for collective liberation if allowed to remain in the group, and should therefore be labeled as outside the project for public relations purposes, we will call the “alternative hypothesis” (usually denoted H1). For any person, there must exist some distribution that defines the probability of each scenario being true. Imagine it looks like this.\nThe overlap of the two distributions reflects a trade-off between false positive and false negatives. If you are really concerned to make one type of error as unlikely as possible, you increase the probability of the other. We can never know for sure, so the idea of being exactly right in every case is not possible. So we have to decide the threshold of confidence we need to exclude someone from our group. Are we comfortable with a 5% chance of being incorrect? A 50% chance of being incorrect? In the graph above, “any mean” refers to how often you are willing to be wrong after operating on your judgment over a large number of cases. To decide how comfortable we should be with false positives and false negatives, we need to have a sense of the costs of each type of error.\nWhat is the real cost of an undetected fascist being in our group?\nWhat is the real cost of ejecting someone who could and would help make revolution?\nNow, these are very interesting and highly debatable questions. Future revolutionaries will need to devote themselve to answering these questions. At present, the main point to understand is that contemporary left culture does not think, let alone debate, these questions. Current left culture operates on the assumption the cost of a false negative is very high and that the cost of false positives is very low. It doesn’t take a social scientist to predict what will happen: you will be very effective in making sure no Nazis are hiding in your groups, but you will also ensure that many good people are pushed out.\nThe non-linear temporal dynamics of paranoid leftism So what will happen if we operate on this set of assumptions? Let’s say we start out with a nice sizeable number of anti-fascist comrades, 100, say. At first, maybe you find some people on the street who kind of look like Nazis so you tell them they can’t be in your movement and they go home very sad. These people turn out to be good people, so in fact you lost a few potential supporters but your group is still 100 people, so no big deal. Those poor guys are expendable, an unfortunate cost of your noble responsibility to keep the streets clean. But a few weeks later someone accuses one of your own member of having fascist sympathies, so the group decides to eject them. Turns out they were a secret member of the KKK, so everyone is delighted at their good judgment! You decide that everyone should be even more on guard to fascists, so you increase your allowable Type 1 error rate even higher. So the next week you kick out two members who later turn out to be good people who would have done much more good than harm had they stayed in the group. Here, the power of your group decreases concretely, due to your errors, but only a little bit. It decreases by a quantity of 2 power units, say, the lost power of those two people. Some concerns about this are raised within the group, but everyone decides it’s just an unfortunate byproduct of keeping the group safe. This is where you start to get non-linear effects that very few radicals want to think about.\nNow, some of the other good people in the group realize there is a decent chance I will become a false positive. Realizing this, they either leave the group out of very reasonable fear of being unfairly and incorrectly maligned, or if leaving is not an option (if, for instance, their identity and relationships are dependent on the radical left milieu), what will they do? They will do everything they can to find a fascist in their midst, to demonstrate to their group their fearless and passionate anti-fascist credibility! Fortunately, since they believe nothing bad really happens if we incorrectly diagnose a good person as fascist, protecting their anti-fascist credibility is not even a very taxing task: just take your best guess among any other member, if they are a fascist you’re a vigilant hero and if they are not, well that’s just an unavoidable byproduct of you valiantly keeping the group safe. Well, to see the outcome of this situation, consider the following figure, which plots the predicted size of your noble left project as a function of your comfort with false positives. The inflection point where the size of your group rapidly plunges toward zero can be thought of as that false-positive error-rate at which good members have good reason to fear being incorrectly labeled fascist. As soon as that happens, the whole project is doomed.\nParanoid leftism can be formally defined as the pathological insistence on sub-optimally high Type 1 error rates.\nThere is only one non-obvious extension I would like to make. I believe the internet exacerbates the problem of under-estimating the cost of false-positives. Why? For the simple reason that the internet increases the number of people one can communicate and establish affiliations with, and there are a very small number of fascists relative to the number of good people, all of whom we have more or less equal and direct access to. Radicals have to remember that everything they say and do has effects not only on every individual we interact with, but also, rapidly, on the large number of individuals that individual interacts with. So reputational effects cut both ways: ejecting good people as inadequately anti-fascist loses trust among many people who simply do not inform you about it. If you accidentally eject one good person for being inadequately anti-fascist, you will lose the trust of the much larger group of people who trust that person, but who just happen to be sociologically distant from you. Therefore paranoid anti-fascism pretends to be about preserving trust with oppressed people but it’s really about avoiding difficult conversations with socially proximate actors. False positives patently destroy trust toward the very notion of organizing radical social change. Most people in the wealthy countries come to see radical groups as ridiculous losers with no credibility, in part because we run around eating our own in ways that anyone other than us can see to be stupid and insane.\nThe paranoid leftist values their own discomfort with impurity and their own reputation within a small miliue more than the prospect of generating large-scale, emancipatory, cultural dynamics tending toward the dissolution of fascism and the promotion of egalitarianism and abundance. The neo-Nazi is a fascist of the short-run; the paranoid leftist is a fascist of the long-run. It is a way of being so concerned with signaling the appearance of opposition to Bad People that you would rather see the power of your own movement decrease than assume the responsibility of simply explaining one’s reasoned judgments in difficult conversations with a small number of people who might be “concerned.”\n","date":1492992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"7913fe474f123f8e51b65e0d2ead9097","permalink":"/blog/2017/04/24/the-formal-structure-of-paranoid-leftism/","publishdate":"2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/04/24/the-formal-structure-of-paranoid-leftism/","section":"post","summary":"How choosing personal psychological comfort over empirical accuracy will doom you and your friends to oblivion.","tags":["radical politics","social science","mechanisms","activism"],"title":"The formal structure of paranoid leftism (why there is no such thing as a noble error)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":" While many people on the left still pretend that \u0026ldquo;free speech\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;political correctness\u0026rdquo; are fake right-wing concepts, a number of us are beginning to realize the profound mistake of dismissive moral posturing. Get your popcorn ready now, because it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a fascinating mess as more and more people on the left begin to realize that the cultural politics of policing moral symbols has been fully exhausted and defeated.\nThe collective-emancipatory gains of genuine truth-seeking are now so massive compared to the rapidly diminishing marginal returns to the moral model, that there is no reason to spend much effort trying to convince the remaining moralists. First, If I am right that the truth-seeking model is better, then it will win because it is better, whether I convince anyone in a blog post or not. Second, I am practicing it, so if I am right then by simply thinking and doing what I am thinking and doing, you’ll see how it works in practice. If I’m wrong, my ideas will fizzle out and I’ll go away. In any event, what I would like to do here is simply unpack some of the notions I have been referring to in not-fully-explained shorthand. To begin, what do I mean when I refer to the “moral model” and the “truth-seeking” model?\nThe moral model vs. the truth-seeking model of radical politics By “left moralism” or any of the other cognate phrases I sometimes use to this effect, I am referring to the model of political activism that seeks to change society by enforcing moral prohibitions. I think this is far and away the most widely held mental model of how progressive social change can and should be achieved, in moderate as well as radical circles. Make a list of words and ideas and types of behavior that are good, and try to get people to identify with them, talk about them, and go to meetings around them. Sometimes these words seem very concrete and action-oriented (such as “strike”) but nonetheless, if you observe like an anthropologist would, you find that an overwhelming portion of the energy is organized around identification with certain words and ideas believed to be in some sense normatively good or desirable. Always curiously lacking is impartial assessment of effects. Also, make a list of words and ideas and types of behavior that are bad and politics means discouraging these by whatever means necessary. Radical politics means really strongly discouraging these things. An important feature of this model is that what, exactly, should be on the list of bad things is a question that is not in principle open to question or debate. It is a characteristic of the moralist model that questioning its basic premises is itself one of the bad things to be discouraged; “good politics” means granting the goodness of the list and it’s enforcement, simply because that’s the moral thing to do. In practice, today, what’s actually on the list of bad things is generally determined through reverse dominance hierarchy in which deference is given to the most institutionally dominated individuals and groups you happen to be around. To be clear, I don’t think this is a totally unreasonable model. It kind of makes sense: society oppresses people unequally so give some priority to oppressed people in defining what is bad and everyone try to stop the occurrence of those bad things from happening. Not necessarily perfect but fair enough.\nI use the phrase “truth-seeking” as an informal and intuitive name for what I could just as well call “scientific method.” The problem with “scientific method” is that for a lot of people this will sound too grandiose for thinking and acting around everyday cultural questions. Not to mention a lot of people think “scientific method” applied to social questions is impossible or harmful to begin with (it’s not, it’s just harder to apply to social questions than to something like physical objects). But most people agree that our ideas about the world around us can be more or less accurate, more or less consistent with how things actually work outside of us, and most people can admit they have an inner sense of when their ideas are proven true by reality (something works as you expect it to), and when their ideas are proven false by reality (something you are doing produces unexpected, undesirable outcomes).\nSo when I talk about “truth-seeking,” all I mean is informally but seriously subjecting all of one’s beliefs, opinions, and mental models of the world to the basic guidelines of scientific method in an everday, intuitive fashion. Basically: everything you think is just a theory, and everything you observe at all times is data you compare to what your theory would have predicted; you need to actively consider all plausible alternative theories and you update your mental models of the world accordingly. You can, and should, have unique background experiences and feelings and creative quirks; scientific method in no way discourages or disqualifies any of that, as it is popular for naïve humanists to suggest. Indeed, truth-seeking is actually the only way to remain loyal to your unique experiences and quirks: the scientific method provides the key for translating your unique data into power over your unique environment, by subjecting your thoughts to objective rules that are guaranteed to give you the best possible command of your unique situation. So this isn’t just an academic protocol; it’s the only way to live a basically honest and mature life, and I would argue it’s a basic pre-requisite for anyone who would hope to contribute to the elimination of oppression by complex social structures.\nSo the “truth-seeking” model of radical politics is fundamentally opposed to the moral model. The moral model says to begin with what is currently defined as morally bad (typically through reverse dominance hierarchies), and devote yourself to discouraging and generally reducing the prevalence of those things. The moral model requires specifically that nobody question the fundamental goodness of that model, or the wisdom of certain items being placed on the list of prohibitions, because the whole strategy is based precisely on forcing conformity to Goodness. The truth-seeking model’s only rule is that you must be honest about your data and how you’re making inferences from that data, but otherwise everyone should just do their best trying to understand how oppressive structures function and how to think/speak/act with others in the precise ways that will predictably overthrow those structures in favor of equality and liberation. The moral model’s final endgame is a world in which all badness goes away through mass conformity with moral criteria. The truth-seeking model’s final endgame is, through diverse and totally free experimentation, we collectively unlock our true functional relationships to oppressive social machinery while immanently rewiring them into correctly-functioning liberation machines.\nWhy the moral model will not go down without a fight The reason the opening of a free-speech cleavage on the left is going to be really messy is that a large number of people have so long schooled themselves in the cultural politics of moralism, and have for so long avoided the very different protocols of truth-seeking (i.e. scientific method), that such a paradigm shift will understandably be experienced as a mortal threat to their identity. And we know that human beings will sooner go to war than reasonably reflect on anything that threatens fundamental dimensions of their identity. People have staked years of effort and many of their social relationships on a model that is suddenly obsolete, so it’s reasonable for such people to be confused and fearful about their place in the future of radical politics, let alone society. Fortunately, scientific method has an extraordinary egalitarian feature that goes woefully under-celebrated in radical circles: it’s equally demonstrable (ultimately) to anyone who is willing to work at understanding it.\nThe whole politics of left-moralism is actively anti-egalitarian because it’s logic is not readily and equally available to all interested parties. There are many social and economic factors that make access to scientific method unequally distributed, of course, but it has the uniquely egalitarian-emancipatory feature of at least being intelligible and employable by all who can find their way to it. The protocols of the left-moral model are not only beset by the same basic problems of unequal access (this is why educational privilege is curiously the single non-demonized privilege in left-moral culture), but the protocols of how to think and act politically on the left-moral model are not available to all in principle. They are unequally accessible by definition, so even if they start out noble and true, there is no way for large groups of humans to hold each other accountable to them in a fashion equally consistent with their truth. The magical techniques of being an ideal ally in the moral war—in which, one day certain words are declared good and the next day they are designated impermissible, according to a logic that does not exist out of the declarations of those groups and individuals who happen to be at the top of constantly shifting reverse dominance hierarchies—is therefore inegalitarian in principle. This is not to cry woe for the exclusion of white men from power (as will be the immediate rejoinder to my point here), it is to cry woe for anyone anywhere who might like to enter revolutionary movements for liberation from diverse starting points. The left-moral model is inherently illegible for anyone who is not able to go through narrow, fickle, local person-driven power dynamics to receive the day’s edicts on what is good and bad. Scientific method, while beset by problems of unequal access as with everything under capitalism, at least has the egalitarian virtue of being written down, basically unchanging, and citable to all.\nThe two models represent two different bio-chemical equilibria I think a lot of smart and genuinely good people on the left operate on this model simply because, as a really-existing cultural structure, it can always inflict very real punishments they are not personally able to risk at the moment (ostracism) and it really delivers rewards they are not personally able to forego at the moment (social stability, standing and status in the in-group, efficacy, purity, etc.)\nBut the whole point of being a radical or revolutionary is to actively cultivate a higher tolerance for social punishment than bourgeois normies, and less reliance on the everyday psychological payoffs that bourgeois normies require to make their sad lives livable.\nThe revolutionary life, the life that genuinely risks itself in the name of what it believes, operates on a totally different equilibrium. Through cultivated attitude and iterating behavioral practice, we push our social punishment tolerance to the human maximum (but no more), our reliance on disingenous bourgeois psychological tricks to the human minimum (but no less), but we set our truth-seeking and truth-speaking/behaving high enough that it becomes a unique and inviolable source of two key resources. First, it provides motivation/energy replacing that which is lost by foregoing the convential bourgeois channels, because any genuine process of truth-seeking is by definition interesting, inspiring, and endless. Second, it provides actual power, for oneself and for whoever you wish to share it with, insofar as increasing your understanding over the social average unlocks concrete pathways to change the world around you despite that most people are content to leave the world as it is. Read the biography of any well-known revolutionary in history (anyone whose life itself participated in world-historical effects), whether it be a political revolutionary or creative/cultural revolutionary, and you will find they are not just different or more extreme than their contemporaries. You will find they organized their life on this fundamentally different equilibrium, a qualitatively different organization of energy inputs and ouputs, which provide the sustainable bio-chemical basis necessary for producing systemically transformative truths despite extreme social punishment and very little bourgeois subjectivity-maintenance.\nConclusion The left-moralist model will protest the new school loudly and insistently until one day you just don’t hear from it anymore. This day is probably much sooner than most people think. Very soon the whole fashion of generalized moral condemnation will be so fully outed as an intellectually disingenuous and practically conservative tendency, that everyone will soon be pretending they never engaged in that embarrasing old fad. And the new cool kids on the block will be all those who are currently risking themselves on truth-seeking, those who were willing to take a little bit of heat from sad moralists in favor of seeking what really works for producing large-scale liberation dynamics. The reason I know this is not because I’m special; quite the contrary, it is because some version of this pattern characterizes all epochal transformations. A scientific outlook makes you larger by making you smaller, for it allows you to find a humble but real role in a set of infinitely larger objective processes.\n","date":1492387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"6bf7fcb12bb085f220b9ad6ce0b2ee84","permalink":"/blog/2017/04/17/two-cultures-of-radical-politics/","publishdate":"2017-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/04/17/two-cultures-of-radical-politics/","section":"post","summary":"Why morality preserves the status quo and science is the key to overthrowing it.","tags":["radical politics","social science"],"title":"Two cultures of radical politics","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"In the past week, many associates of mine on the radical left have expressed grave concern about my recent cultural politics. If you haven’t been following, here’s my best shot at a succinct, impartial recap. I have been blogging about what it means to engage intellectually with smart people on the right. By \u0026ldquo;smart people on the right,\u0026rdquo; I mean people with non-trivial intellectual projects defending right-wing perspectives, potentially even including some that appear horrifying and/or evil. I use the word “smart” only to exclude from the mind two images that have come to define “conservatism” in the left-wing imagination: infantile and fundamentally disingenuous politicians, and then mindless, racist armies of trolls. Specifically, for instance, I have expressed interest in the writings of Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug; I recently hosted a podcast with psychologist Diana Fleischman that included discussion of controversial topics such as “human biodiversity” (some say this is a euphemism for racism and some say it’s an empirical reality). Obviously not the usual talking points for a left-wing intellectual, but to be clear nobody is accusing me of writing or saying anything particularly impeachable. I did receive some very thoughtful concerns, however, so one goal of this post is to clarify at least one or two of the most fair and important criticisms I have received. This is a caring thing to do, and I still believe deeply in caring.\nOn the other hand, any culture of absolute kindness becomes a conservative system of unspoken violence insofar as painful truths get repressed and all participants become deformed over time. It is because I genuinely love my friends on the left that I am stepping up to publicly state, and seriously pursue the implications of, dozens of difficult questions we have basically had an unspoken pact to not speak about for perhaps decades now.\nIf you are one of my comrades on the left who is generally overexposed to human docility or illness, I must also warn you, caringly, that you might be alarmed or confused by what follows. Many of you are now accustomed to a particular script: comrade is “problematic,” group pulls moral alarm, comrade begs forgiveness and (even in the best of cases, not to mention the horror shows), comrade dies a little on the inside, group feels reassured comrade will do no harm, group grows old and gray wondering why they never changed the world. Well, I have seen this script performed too many times to play along any longer; over the past several years I think I have learned a thing or two about why our groups don’t change the world. One reason is that we punish our own for grappling with questions we pretend to understand but are in fact to fearful to seriously consider.\nSo at the same time this post will charitably respond to some left-wing critiques of my project, in the same breath I am going to unapolagetically push further outward on my perspective that so horrifies many of you. I will no longer fight rearguard battles against fearful and disingenuous people on the left who would rather condemn something than admit they don’t have the time to read and process it; but neither am I here to cozy up with right-wing currents, as so many on the left assume of anyone who starts really speaking up and speaking out. I should like to become a worthy opponent of the smart wings of the new reaction, rather than merely pretend they are stupid; for I consider it a great embarrassment that the revolutionary left has yet to generate anything as genuinely interesting and creative as The Dark Enlightenment or Unqualified Reservations. If so-called left-acclerationism is our best response, then we’re in deep trouble (see below). Fortunately, I think we can do much, much better, but we won’t know until we try.\nOne of the key objections put forward by my more thoughtful critics from the left is the following. They argue that it is ethically and/or politically wrong to entertain a frame of debate in which racist implications appear likely. For example, my podcast with Diana is ethically or politically bad because by even discussing biological differences across groups, I am effectively increasing the perceived legitimacy of notions that can and will be used to support racist ideas or policies. I think this is a reasonable concern based on a plausible model of culture. Yet after reflecting on this for several years, I believe this idea is fatally mistaken in ways that have not yet been fully grasped or written down anywhere (that I know of, anyway). Here is a first, short attempt.\nThis idea that it is ethically or politically wrong to entertain a certain frame of debate is a fatal error in both the normative and empirical sense of that term. First, on the normative level, the idea of refusing to engage people with certain frames of reference dehumanizes people who have no access to anything other than those frames of reference. In short, this objection writes off large swaths of humanity as inhuman. I believe that this monopoly on humanity claimed by educated leftists is now, on net, a more violent and reactionary phenomenon than any legitimacy that would be given to racism by even talking with a proper racist (let alone decent people who merely have dicey or controversial positions). What many on the left ignore is that today large swaths of human beings are, through no fault of their own, socialized into right-wing and often racist frames. There exists a large number of people who are racist because they were sociologically doomed from birth to be racist (e.g. poor undeducated white kids in racist families and geographies are statistically doomed to be racist). Their humanity has been robbed from them (as it’s increasingly robbed from everyone).\nIt is my view that the revolutionary left is absolutely obligated to treat such people as the humans they truly are despite the dehumanization they have been subjected to. When the “humane” leftist says thou shall not engage with any racist “framing” of a conversation, they are saying that large swaths of essentially innocent people do not have the right to think, speak, or participate in public life, i.e. this position coldly writes off the past and continued dehumanization of literally millions of people. Leftists think they are being radically humane, guarding the last line of defense against the collapse of human equality, but the horrifying mistake nobody is willing to reflect on is that this is actually saying “keep those filthy animals out of the little circle of humanity I still get to enjoy with my educated friends.”\nThe genuinely humane, revolutionary-emancipatory position in contemporary culture is that we must dare to do the cognitively and emotionally terrifying, and dangerous, work of extending whatever last shreds of humanity we have, to everyone we possibly can. Therefore, the truly humane, caring, revolutionary gambit today ethically requires us to “engage with racist frames.” As a militant antifascist, I also believe in drawing lines across which absolute refusal or physical resistance becomes the correct move: to me, the clear line is if someone is actively engaged in violence or directly inciting it. I would not have a conversation with a neo-Nazi marching in my town throwing bottles at immigrants; I would, with my community, physically remove them from my town. All I am saying is that to draw this line of militant non-engagement at the level of “thinking and speaking with a racist frame” would require us to tell millions of people to go die in the cesspool they were born into. We have been effectively doing that for decades now, and not only does it fail, but it appears to engender or intensify novel mutations of racist politics (e.g., carefully non-explicit white “identitarian” movements, etc).\nContinuing from the previous part, the second problem is as follows. This notion that it can be wrong, a priori, to consider certain frames of reference is a grave error in the practical or strategic sense as well, because to cast off so many people as inhuman casts off all of the humans we would need to change anything. It empirically dooms the left to never achieve the fundamental transformations we claim to be fighting for. If you listen to smart people on the right, they are currently laughing their way to the end of humanity as the left continues to push deeper and deeper into the mistakes we are actively refusing to learn from. It is very difficult for the few revolutionary leftists still alive to confront this, because it’s genuinly so vertiginous and horrifying that it really approaches what is cognitively and emotionally unsurvivable for genuinely caring people: there are at least some objective reasons to believe the human species may be genuinely crossing the threshold at which exponentially increasing technological efficiency makes the absolute end of humanity an objective and irreversible empirical reality. I think it’s debatable where we are at in that process, but it seems undeniable this question is now genuinely at stake and I simply don’t see a single person on the revolutionary left seriously considering this with the radical honesty it requires.\nIf folks like Srnicek and Williams and the “post-capitalism” types are the best the radical left has to offer on this front, I’m very sorry but we’re in serious trouble. No disrespect to those folks, they are all very good and smart people. But that is exactly the problem. A really profound problem nobody on the left wants to consider is that being a “good person” imposes psychological constraints on your most basic capacities to think and express yourself honestly. To understand this, we need to take a little historical detour.\nRecall that capitalist society only emerged and grew on hypocrisy as the standard mode for cognitively and emotionally managing the necessity of having to brutally exploit each other to survive. This hypocrisy is what the word “bourgeois” means, and it is nothing less than the naturalized lifestyle of everyone who qualifies as a “good person” in modernity. Because living as a human being under capitalism requires hypocrisy, being empirically correct about what is happening and how the world functions (science) as well as interpersonally adequate to each other (what is called “caring,” or saying/doing what helps specific other people in specific moments) are mutually exclusive to a substantial degree. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt has shown with several years of research that people who identify with the political left are disproportionately interested in “care” as a value; conservatives have a more multi-dimensional “palette” of moral foundations). To be clear, I am in fact deeply interested in the value of care, which is one reason I find myself sociologically on the left-wing of political culture. The unique challenge I don’t see anybody on the radical left seriously confronting is how our committment to care comes with the cost of certain systematic errors we happily ignore by dishonestly repeating over and over that we ignore them because we “care.” The issue here is that, it is programmed into the nature of a capitalist bourgeois society that to pursue unlimited “care” means that you objectively do not care about changing reality. This is because changing something as complex as “society” requires an extremely sophisticated empirical rigor deeply at odds with the care we also need to exercise in order to cooperatively change things together as diverse human beings. How to achieve the optimal balance of these genuinely contradictory tendencies is, in my view, one of the million-dollar questions for any serious revolutionary political thought today.\n(An aside. The first and most stupendous person to see all of this in the early stages of capitalist modernity, who so clearly saw the doomed destiny of any society organized on hypocrisy, that he preferred to sacrifice his public “goodness” to produce monuments of honesty so outrageous he hoped they would raze the hypocritical order altogether, was, of course, Rousseau. Now, Rousseau did not squash the rise of bourgeois hypocrisy, but he had demonstrable effects in generating the modern revolutionary left tradition as we know it, from the French Revolution to Fanon and beyond. There are many good critiques of Rousseau, but if there is one example of how a sincere individual can craft a life that contributes to genuinely collective, world-historical waves of revolutionary political change, it is surely Rousseau. If this aside does not help you to see the world-historical difference between my own perspective and the neo-reaction, then it is unlikely any other citations ever will.)\nIn my view, this tradeoff between being correct about how the world works and caring for each other enough that we can cooperatively change it in the direction of peace and abundance for all—this is perhaps the most vexing and urgent puzzle for a genuine revolutionary left today. Yet remarkably I am not aware of a single person genuinely risking themselves on solving it, so I’m going to try. At present I am working on understanding the mechanisms whereby such an important problem has somehow been so stubbornly invisible to so many of us for so long. My wager is that we if we can truly understand the mechanisms of our own blindness, we will find pathways to the holy grail of the revolutionary left tradition: the flourishing of all human beings in peace and abundance, immediately, without recourse to all of the right-wing solutions that get raised in direct response to the left’s willful neglect of exactly this impasse.\nIt is because of this tradeoff between being correct and caring that I have recently become interested in what I have been referring to as the “smart” right-wing. Many people are concerned that my recent interest in intelligence means that I’ve become an IQ elitist or something. On the contrary, I am keenly suspicious of the politics of high-IQ subcultures, precisely because I know there is a trade-off between being correct and caring. Because we care about each other, there are certain things we refuse to see or else refuse to tell each other about what is really true. That’s fine, and perhaps a hard constraint of the types of beings we are on the radical left. But “smart” far-right people, who do not give a fuck about how people feel, they might just be the only ones capable of telling us those truths we need to process if we are ever going to have a sufficent command on reality to generate the systemic transformations we believe in. But at the same time, I am highly skeptical that the evacuation of care is a viable political project, because warmth is a condition of life for we creatures who require the sun to live, we creatures who are literally composed of a once-exploded star. I think right-accelerationists are wagering on the possibility that, if technologically super-charged hypercapitalism is understood correctly (hence the call to minimize care), that is objectively the most likely path for the possibility of surviving, perhaps into the becoming of something post-human.\nFor instance, a remarkable feature of Nick Land’s current writing is his obsession with coldness; I have never read anyone who so conscientiously endorses the absolute evacuation of care as a political project. Many on the left find this so evil they are resolutely insisting that if one so much as speaks his name with even one non-negative adjective in the same sentence, that very act is enough to force the speaker out of the publicly defined circle of “good humans” into that outside zone of cast-off inhumanity (consider that Land’s handle is @outsideness), via the same intellectual-social process I described above. If we self-servingly cast off human beings as if they are sub-human, we cannot then feign surprise and indignation if they say, “OK then! I’ll go off to become one with the superintelligent eugenically produced cyborg overloads you’ll be enslaved by in a couple of generations and I will laugh my ass off all the way to the singularity!” That’s the vibe I get when I browse Nick Land’s ongoing work, and when I look at the objective reality of runaway global finance and the tech sector, it does not seem implausible that something like this could potentially be underway. Of course I find that horrifying, which is why I am calling absolute bullshit on the people who say that it’s “too evil to engage.” On the contrary, it’s too alarming not to engage.\nThe more evil you think someone is, the greater should be your concern to ensure there is not the slightest chance they understand something better than you. If they are so evil, and they understand even one tiny thing you don’t, perhaps they are off using that edge in knowledge to engineer you out of existence. This suggests to me that when people say, “intellectual engagement with person X is prohibited,” what they are actually saying is “we are so afraid they might be part of the superintelligent cyborg army coming to enslave us that, even if they are literally preparing to, we do not want to know about it, *even if there is a chance that we can still stop them!*” And this is where I get off the train to nowhere, for this is where moderate respectable leftism (including most currently existing “radical” variants) converges with the most insiduous and cowardly conservatism. If there is some chance that hyperintelligent cyborgs are preparing to overtake humanity once and for all, because there is some chance that for generations now they have been operating on a model of the world we made it our pact to never consider, then I’m going to take a real look. Not everyone has to be comfortable doing so themselves, but at this point I think that any honest, decent, thinking being on the radical left will at least allow me to try.\nI believe that currently, a dirty little secret on the the left is that for some people, the “left” is an agreement to protect each other’s right to look away from the most horrifying and potentially tragic realities of planetary life today, to (implicitly) secure amongst ourselves the last bits of interpersonal warmth available on the planet, agreeing to allow the rest of humanity’s descent into irreversible coldness. It helps to explain why, if you even approach these issues with the slightest indication of analytical coldness, you have to be ejected from the warmth cartel, for ejecting such existential threats is a condition of its survival. But I believe it has always been the vocation of the revolutionary left, properly understood, to risk its own survival on deploying just enough analytical coldness to engineer the unique machine that would take as an input the left’s unique material resource (warmth or energy via care) and produce as an output non-linear, systemic dynamics the ultimate equilibrium state of which would be peace and abundance for all. What that machine looks like is the question, and this is only a formal statement to illustrate the revolutionary left position today as an engineering problem. There are many reasons that have been adduced as to why such a machine cannot exist, and I do not pretend to offer responses to them here. I am only suggesting that any revolutionary left today, worthy of the name, would need to “solve for X,” as it were. The point of the engineering metaphor is not that everybody in the revolutionary movement will need to be an engineer, not at all; the point is only to show that any left-revolutionary project, to succeed, will have to solve this engineering problem.\nWhat does this mean for revolutionary politics, in plain conversational terms? By putting all of our eggs in the basket of care and kindness, the radical left is now suffering from an engineering crisis it does not have enough engineers to even notice. In short, making revolution is a complex practical problem we are not solving because we are now generations deep in a long-term strategy of prohibiting people who are good at high-level problem solving but bad at being polite. Not to mention people who are good at creative and social openness, but bad at obeying rules. Thinkers of the respectable-radical left, people such as Paul Mason or Srnicek and Williams are selling a hope of technological super-abundance, but they are too sweet to tell any of their left comrades that all of the people you would need to actually produce that super-abundance are off building hyper-exploitative super-capitalism in part because they once went to an activist meeting and everyone treated them like fascists. To bring this back to anti-capitalist basics, the reason left post-capitalist thinkers don’t reflect much on such little problems as this one is because selling books is as mutually exclusive with truth-telling, in the short run, as is being a “nice person.” Hence the need for a fundamentally anti-bourgeois revolutionary intellectual culture cold enough to seek all of the darkest truths, but still warm enough not to betray the calling of solidarity. I’m not saying the left should start worshipping cold analytical power; all I’m saying is that if we genuinely believe in the necessity of changing the world, a revolutionary culture would have to be at least minimally hospitable to a minimal number of people who have knowledge of how complex things work and how they break, and people with the traits and inclinations to maneuver among diverse others. Both types of people are effectively prohibited from those who currently define radical progressive politics. Contemporary radical left culture is now so fully doubled-down on the wager of kindness over intelligence and creativity, that I am afraid it is almost vacuum-sealed against learning why it might be on the verge of extinction. I am writing this, and will continue writing to this effect, on the last-ditch possibility there exist other people out there, somewhere, who can see in this something more important than a moral offense.\n","date":1491868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569113675,"objectID":"8d90d1015782c0898599afb4e379b494","permalink":"/blog/2017/04/11/on-turning-left-into-darkness/","publishdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/04/11/on-turning-left-into-darkness/","section":"post","summary":"A response to critics and a more positive elaboration of my current thinking.","tags":["ideology","radical politics","activism"],"title":"On turning left into darkness","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"First, I am generally skeptical that any intellectually radical thought or speech that takes place within the wealthy liberal democracies today has much effect on anyone, for better or worse. So it is hard to see how intellectual or even social engagement with polar ideological opposites (even if one thinks their positions are plainly wrong or violent) would itself cause unique negative consequences of any kind. The genuinely thinking members of the ultraleft and ultraright are so few and marginal that it strikes me that this fear of “dangerous associations” is a narcissistic delusion; it’s a way of pretending that anyone gives a shit about what we think or say. Nobody cares, and that’s an essential part of our predicament, that human beings today are quite fully pacified and neutralized in their capacity to be moved.\nIt stands to reason that, if there is any way out of our collective virtual jail cells of separation and alienation, it might have to involve finding those who are most alien and frightening, to see if perhaps they know something we don’t. To see if, possibly, one reason the revolution never comes is that it’s always been posited on this obsessive insistence that our evil enemies could not possibly know something we do not know. Even if you believe someone is evil, you can still wonder if they know something you don’t. Clearly, collective revolutionary liberation has not occurred yet, so almost by definition there must be a large number of things ultraleftists remain fundamentally incorrect about, right? I don’t think it’s such a crazy idea to suppose that the most intelligent people on the right could be a source of great insight, especially into the dumbest and most ineffectual aspects of ourselves, aspects which we are possibly unable to see as clearly as we need to. I understand this is a moral heresy on the left, but what if this very structure of paranoid-neurotic moral prohibitions is itself one of the most dangerous problems, and one we are uniquely ill-equipped to see in ourselves, by ourselves? This seems not only plausible but, in my view, increasingly likely to be true.\nThere is this fear that engaging with what one takes to be bad ideas will function as legitimation of those ideas, and that this will then spread them. There are two really hard problems with this view. First, I think we have to wake up to the empirical reality that left-wing culture has been collectively practicing this strategy of disengagement and disavowal for the past several years and the effect has been a flourishing of radical right-wing perspectives today. So the “distance and delegitimate” strategy of dealing with one’s ideological opposites is arguably the most dangerous way to relate to those one disagrees with (this is assuming one is correct and one’s opponents are wrong, that the others are in fact dangerous, which could itself be a pathological arrogance also symptomatic of what’s wrong with us). Hence the second problem with this attitude is that it assumes one knows for sure one is fully correct and one’s extreme ideological opposites are fully incorrect. I think this is a patently stupid presumption; most people use political ideas as blankets to keep them warm, and that’s fine, but the reality is that no matter how much one believes what one believes there is always the possibility that perhaps one has been wrong all along and one’s ideological opposites have been correct all along. This may be very unsettling, but it appears to be an unavoidable difficulty baked into reality itself, and no amount of militance can overwrite such difficulties by force.\nFinally, even if it is “dangerous” to liaison with thinkers of seemingly evil thoughts, I would say the whole point of a radical or revolutionary political position is to actively cultivate a higher-than-average tolerance for danger. Is it not odd that people who claim to believe in radical critique and revolutionary social change speak of “dangerousness” as something to be avoided? Again, I see here a symptom of the mystified mechanisms of our own pacification. The truth is, I desire some danger. If only my thinking and communication behaviors were dangerous! If there is any danger to dialogue with the radical right, I think I would simply say that I am not afraid of it. I trust in the capacities of human beings to distinguish true from false in the long run, I trust that we will converge on the truth ultimately but only if we, perhaps somewhat dangerously, are willing to consider everything, especially that which we are most emotionally invested in (for that is almost certainly where our errors will be found). And I believe strongly that whatever the truth about human beings is, finding it out cannot hurt us any more than all of the prevailing falsities. The catch is that one has to at least entertain the possibility that what one fears and loathes the most could potentially turn out to contain some truth. If that’s dangerous, then I would think it is precisely the type of danger revolutionaries should be faulted for not seeking out more eagerly.\n","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"f3eaa6192b7ac44faf7f65423405dcef","permalink":"/blog/2017/03/27/is-it-dangerous-to-engage-seriously-with-radical-right-wing-thinkers/","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/03/27/is-it-dangerous-to-engage-seriously-with-radical-right-wing-thinkers/","section":"post","summary":"If only it were.","tags":["radical politics","ideology"],"title":"Is it dangerous to engage seriously with radical right-wing thinkers?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"The amount of bullshit circulating at the moment is astounding. And to be clear, it appears to be just as bad in left-wing circles. In fact, what I see happening on the left is the most troubling to me because that’s where I’m positioned. There’s this idea you should “punch up” or focus one’s criticisms on one’s “enemies” but I think that’s a fatally mistaken notion. If you and your friends are thinking or doing something incorrectly, that is the most urgent issue.\nAs a political scientist, the truth is I usually don\u0026rsquo;t have that much to offer regarding current affairs. I think most social scientists, if they are being honest, have to admit this with respect to most issues at most times. But if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing my “expertise” gives me, if I have one valuable thing to offer in a time of crisis, it\u0026rsquo;s a highly refined bullshit detector. If there is one thing you learn as a well-trained social scientist, it is this: it is so hard to make correct inferences about what is going on in social phenomena. Most of the training of a social scientist is learning all the reasons why you cannot make certain inferences. So in times of crisis, when most people seem over-eager to make inferences (as a way of dealing with all of the cognitive and emotional anxieties), it is perhaps here that social scientists are most useful, to remind you that, whatever you think is going on—you are mostly wrong.\nTo be clear, when I say most people are “wrong” about most of their inferences, I don’t mean that nobody ever gets anything right, or that nobody understands anything. We all know a great deal, but it’s mostly embodied, practical knowledge. We know not to put our hand in a fire, and a million other important things. But when our mind starts trying to identify causal patterns in a hyper-complex situation (and really all social phenomenon are hyper-complex), collectively we will generate thousands of hypotheses and most of them will be false. Some will be true, but remember that some would be true even by accident. Monkeys typing on a keyboard long enough would produce true statements in some portion of the text.\nRecognizing our incapacity to know things shouldn’t be distressing or disempowering; it’s humbling, liberating, relaxing, and empowering. It reminds you that the little ball of fat in your skull is actually a pretty faulty device and it’s not really your job to figure out everything going on in the world. Nobody can do that, but a lot of people think they can (and should); if you think you have this responsibility, not only will it drive you crazy but, as I said, on net you will not actually be contributing or helping anything. Again, don’t get me wrong, I think everyone has a lot to contribute—but not in the form of objective explanations of what is happening in the world. We have this ridiculous, faux-democratic notion that everyone is entitled to their own reading of what is happening, but this is wrong. We are all equal, but if anything, I would say we are all equally disentitled to our own readings of what is happening—we are disentitled by objective reality, which is ultimately chaos, and which does not allow any of us the privilege of knowing exactly what is happening or what is causing what. I think we can find a radically more true, honest, and ultimately connective/solidaristic community in the shared realization that I don’t know, you don’t know, but we both know we have each other in this moment. Crucially, you can adopt this attitude in good conscience as well, because it’s nobody’s moral or political burden—not even social scientists’—to save the world or a country or a people by pretending to have knowledge nobody can have\nWe are seeing right now the extraordinary mass-delusional implications of a media environment in which every agent believes they are capable of understanding what is happening, there are cultural and often monetary incentives for pretending to know what is happening, and no mechanism for sorting true from false. The primary problem isn’t fake news or purposeful deceit; the problem is massive new injection of noise in the system, everyday cognitive biases, and perverse incentives to perform knowledge where there do not exist mechanisms for testing and sorting knowledge claims (and I would add, absurd Western notions about personal control and responsibility which were temporarily useful in early modernity but are now leading to a kind of mental heat death in the context of the information age).\nOne of the other reasons an academic social scientist comes in handy here is that we do not primarily get paid to make prognostications about what is going on in the present moment. Sometimes people think this makes us “useless,” but indeed our “uselessness” is what makes us useful in times of uncertainty, deception, and mistrust: it is precisely because we generally don’t care about pretending to be useful that if we feel compelled to comment on current affairs, if only to say it is impossible to know something with any confidence, it should be relatively more trustworthy than someone who gets paid to provide useful commentary on a daily basis. In other words, the uncertain offerings of an academic social scientist are more likely to be a signal and articles by professional commentators are more likely to be noise. There is certainly a new cottage industry for academics who wish to enter the culture market of disingenuously over-confident inferences, but our real value is that generally if we are shooting from the hip with little to gain or lose, then you should be able to trust the academic social scientist, relatively. I would ask you to remember, especially if you are passionate about contributing to politics, that false answers are typically more responsible for evil than honest admissions of uncertainty.\nWe have to remember that the human mind has evolved to find patterns, even where they don\u0026rsquo;t exist. This is because, for the greater part of our history, if there was a snake in the grass and we failed to identify it, we could be fucked. But if there was not a snake in the grass and we thought we identified one, no big deal. So we evolved to err on the side of identifying patterns even where there is nothing. But what’s useful for avoiding snakes may very well be collectively suicidal for avoiding an infinite set of possible global threats via the internet. Right-wing people do this with crime and terrorism but left-wing people are doing this just as badly with the new semi-global, right-wing shift. As we now have screens that fling unprecedented volumes of noise at us all day and night (and which allow us to fling noise back into it!), I think we are really underestimating the degree to which our highly faulty human cognition, combined with our individual incentives to perform knowledge, can generate extraordinary harm to individuals and groups, sending collective understandings down systematically erroneous and divergent paths, and ultimately shaping actual behaviors of masses of people. And when the behavior of people is based on any degree of systematic error that is not being corrected over time, this is arguably the most potent recipe for almost all of the worst historical disasters.\nTo put it yet another way, even highly educated and otherwise trustworthy people right now are doing what social scientists call \u0026ldquo;overfitting their models.” In other words, developing theories that can fit all of the data they are observing, without realizing that a great deal of that data is noise. The thing is, a good explanation of noise is a really bad explanation of reality; what this means is that if you act or behave as if such explanations are true, almost by definition it will produce consequences other than the ones you are hoping to produce.\nAgain, this should all be liberating and relaxing to reflect on. If there is honestly a lot of uncertainty, and one honestly does not know, then one honestly deserves to try and relax, pay attention, learn, think, consider possible hypotheses, update them as you go, and in the meantime patiently focus on what you do know (inner convictions, empathy and solidarity for the people you encounter, etc). You are not obligated to go \u0026ldquo;do something\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;say something\u0026rdquo; immediately if the actual reality is such that really you are just scared because you don’t know what is going on.\nOf course, be vigilant, be courageous, say and do what you believe in, but radicalism is an all-or-nothing proposition. If you want to be politically radical, you better also be radically honest, radically humble, and radically transparent. All I\u0026rsquo;m calling for is intellectual honesty regarding uncertainty. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying anyone should dampen their convictions or compromise with anything they find unjust. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying there\u0026rsquo;s nothing radical or even defensible about effectively making shit up because you want to produce some consequence, whether it be the soothing of your own anxiety, the production of \u0026ldquo;hope\u0026rdquo; for others, or the recruitment of others into your group. One of the most radical things you can do at any time is be correct. And in highly uncertain times, the most correct diagnosis of many things will be \u0026ldquo;we do not know.\u0026rdquo; You can still maintain deeply held convictions, and act passionately on various projects, while also maintaining the basic self-discipline of trying to honestly separate signal from noise. Speak and act decisively, at the highest intensity you can sustain, but only on the most correct possible interpretation of information. This is where I think social science converges with the most radical, progressive politics.\n","date":1485993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"c535199b150fde951b535e6c55a073f1","permalink":"/blog/2017/02/02/politics-of-not-knowing/","publishdate":"2017-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/02/02/politics-of-not-knowing/","section":"post","summary":"The real usefulness of social science in times of crisis.","tags":["radical politics","social science","emotions","media"],"title":"Social science and the radical politics of not knowing","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["personal"],"content":" 1 Mark Fisher was a revolutionary, but I do not mean his writings were revolutionary (although they were); I mean that Mark Fisher was a revolutionary in a very specific sense of the word, a sense that does not necessarily apply to everyone who happens to be sympathetic to radical ideas or causes. We know this because, over the past two years, we have not just been friends with Mark. A number of us have been, together, in the process of concrete, organized, revolutionary political transformations. These transformations remain somewhat obscure, and before Mark’s death I did not fully comprehend what he and all of us in Plan C have been doing over these past couple of years. But now, for me at least, Mark\u0026rsquo;s death has been like a flash of emotional lightning that suddenly illuminates a dark forest pulsing with life, revealing with undeniable clarity where one even is. In an email, Mark once wrote to us: “I think we\u0026rsquo;re really onto something…” I think he was right, in fact I think he was more right than any of us have known what to do with. With Mark’s passing I believe I can see more clearly now than ever what exactly we have been onto. To be honest, I did not know Mark well, and I have only a passing familiarity with his writing; that I have so much to say can only be attributed to the political processes that have been, over the past few years, sweeping a few of us away, together.\n2 Mark always struck me as the type whose opposition to the status quo was such that he sincerely thought, felt, and lived as if it could not be so. For some people, opposition to the status quo can be a form of adaptation and survival. For these people, activism provides socio-psychological supports that make the experience of the status quo tolerable. But others are plagued with a humanity that will not go away no matter what you offer it, a certain inability to accept the status quo, an incapacity to integrate oneself into its consistency, resulting in a kind of maladaption risking rather than securing survival. For these types, entry into radical politics is not about making life livable under unlivable conditions, it is about figuring out how to produce genuinely livable conditions at any cost. This is a subtle but crucial difference: the former model waters down the definition of what is considered “living” in order to survive and claim we are “living,” while the latter admits plainly the unfortunate but real challenge of an unjust political order: either overthrow unlivable institutions and make life together possible immediately, or we will already be dead.\nIn my own view, everything seems to suggest that the truly revolutionary life today must be of the latter type; it would seem that revolutionary politics today could not be anything other than a kind of minimally sustainable, reproducible type of militant maladaption, the capacity to creatively occupy oneself as something that consciously and purposely does not belong to nearly all of that which is currently and falsely called reality. But obviously individual human organisms have limits and this tendency can lead to self-destruction; one question we have therefore been grappling with is, how to sustain this kind of creative maladaption over time, how to make revolutionary maladaption socially reproducible.\nIt seems to me that, in his intellectual work, Mark sought actively to inhabit this heady, scandalous mental space in which everything people call real is, clearly, not real. Exciting and true, but anyone who has ever sought to engage in radical intellectual work over a period of time learns quickly that this parallax is quite a load on the nervous system, because every interaction in our really existing Boring Dystopia will require far more emotional and cognitive stress than would be required if one simply took the Boring Dystopia to be real. Now, if we have any hope of living a true life together then we must at all cost hold onto this heady, stressful, critical distance. But I think one thing Mark understood was that there do exist tactics and techniques for making true life possible despite everything. I think Mark was a maestro of such tactics, not just because I got to observe him performing them (as I will sketch below), but because to do his kind of radical theory over any period of time. you need them. That he was able to write all of those words on topics such as mental health and capitalism, in that dangerous and difficult mental space he was most known for, is evidence enough that he possessed some mastery of how to power a life that is not being fueled in the conventional way through complacent, adaptive negotiation with the status quo.\nI should say at the outset that I am not interested in claiming Mark for any particular thesis or agenda; like any genuine, radical intellectual, I am sure he thought many different things that he never brought to perfect coherence. Yet I do believe, for a number of reasons I will try to articulate, that Mark was especially interested in this question about the interpersonal and social tactics that transform individual and group consciousness into weapons that perform concretely revolutionary work (however slowly and invisibly at first) on even the largest-scale political and economic institutions.\nOne reason I know Mark was keen on this point is that he told me so. I remember one time he was telling me about the most recent book project he had been working on. I asked him about the thesis. He summarized it by saying something to the effect of, ”Basically, 1970s socialist feminism had it all figured out.\u0026rdquo; We can debate what he might have meant by this, but I believe he had in mind especially the feminist consciousness-raising groups prevalent at the time. Even more specifically, I think Mark was interested in how these groups—dedicated to the sharing and making visible of once silent, privatized struggles—really worked, not just for “therapy” or the now more chic “self-care” but as a bona fide methodology for producing large-scale, revolutionary political change at the systemic level. The various movements of this one particular historical moment were crushed, yes, but the point is that it worked, as far as it went. Of course, there will be opponents and enemies, but the basic method is a real, concrete, and reproducible way for even lonely individuals and small groups to immediately begin the overthrow of dominant institutions.\nMy memory of his characteristic, nervous excitement seemed to be saying, like, “We already know what to do! Next time, this time, we just have to figure out how not to get crushed!” That is, we have to figure out a number of auxilliary questions that our revolutionary predecessors had not fully worked out—such as how to expand, aggregate, and materially reproduce consciousness-raising dynamics against powerful reactionary forces and agents—but as to the basic nature of revolutionary movement, its primary source and destination as an actual activity human beings can do, we already know it. It is the concrete, immanent process of human beings seeking, through each other, their true consciousness. That might sound woo-woo, but I will argue that the status quo reproduces itself in large part by making this proposition seem woo-woo. Our fear of being naïve, our fear of wagering too much on our own immediate shared consciousness—more and more I think this is the enemy, or at least the single most real and vicious tenterhook that status quo institutions have successfully lodged in our bodies. It seems to me that radicals and activists today may be scrambling to find what is already under their noses, in the historical sense that the 1960s already demonstrated how to produce massive, global, political shockwaves, but also in the immediate interpersonal sense that all we need is exactly whoever is right in front of us.\nAnother minor exhibit. Within the group, I once wrote an essay that argued consciousness-raising is effectively strike action, the real and concrete withdrawal of cognitive and emotional energy from the status quo. The essay was critical of many basic assumptions of contemporary leftism and I know that Mark was sympathetic to the essay. Interestingly, he was very worried about the backlash I might receive, most likely due to his own ghastly experiences taking risks on the internet (which I consider in more detail below). Of course nothing happened, my article received the much harsher fate of a generally tepid response. Nonetheless, this all suggests to me that what I was trying to articulate in that essay overlaps, at least in some degree, with what Mark had been thinking in recent years. Something difficult and apparently sensitive, something that progressive folks either don’t care about or get very angry about. It all seems to indicate that we are getting closer and closer to understanding what exactly we have been onto.\n3 When one speaks the words “consciousness-raising,” the connotation is so strongly one of New-Age spiritualism that, from a political perspective, the conversation is usually over before it starts. I think the coming years will show this to be an error. Nonetheless, for this reason, I prefer to speak of the physiological and biochemical effects of consciousness tactics; how shared consciousness—if all parties truly take that shared consciousness to be more real than official reality and allow their future thoughts and behaviors to morph accordingly—produces concrete attitudinal and behavioral effects that immanently decrease the power flowing into the institutional center while increasing the autonomous power circulating in the commune of those who compose it. Even better, these tactics come with the exceptional virtue of being immediately palpable in the body and mind when executed correctly, and so they are self-guiding and self-reinforcing. Relationships conducted in this fashion become veritable collective revolution machines capable of spanning vast distances, but only if they are done correctly. Such relationships can and will take infinitely different forms, but I think there is perhaps one hard rule. There will be various implications from this rule, implications which will have to be identified and dealt with creatively depending on the situation, but only one hard requirement. In my own view, I summarize it with the word “honesty,” similar to “conscience” but more secular and relational, like “truth” but less formal and more pluralistic.\nIn a nutshell, I would venture a possible definition of consciousness-raising as interpersonal communications, on any scale, motivated by nothing but honesty and unconcerned with consequences. By doing this, conciousness-raising is a form of direct action, immediately available between any two people (or more), that withdraws one’s labour from the status quo and immanently produces what you are welcome to call freedom, energy, joy, or power. At a certain resolution these can all be thought of as interchangeable. While this might sound too simple to be serious revolutionary politics, the truth is it’s very difficult and extremely rare. Consider the extraordinary fact that such an orientation is almost impossible to find in activist circles; almost the entirety of contemporary activism is organized around the pursuit of certain consequences, to such a degree that in activist circles if your thoughts and speech are not perceived as contributing to some future consequence, or if you are not minimally able to produce speech that has certain immediate consequences (e.g. making people feel “hope” or appearing “useful”) then you might as well not even be there.\nThere is massive problem in the activist instinct to organize your thoughts and actions around producing consequences (a fancier term for this is “instrumental rationality,” and it is basically the rationality of modernity and capitalism). The problem is that, in your attachment to those consequences, you are liable to make mistakes and tell lies without even knowing it. And once errors or lies are circulating, however tiny, everything you try to do with anyone will be doomed. First, it leads to the crucial error that you see other human beings as means to some end, whereas in fact the truth is they are ends unto themselves. Humans are not valuable for some purpose, they are the creators of these odd things called values, and if you think about it, that is one of the main reasons why we believe all humans must be free and equal in the first place. But this error is not merely an ethical mistake that does violence to others, it is a practical political mistake also because it blocks revolutionary dynamics before they even have a chance to begin. The whole problem of alienation under capitalism is that we have all been reduced to objects in a system we have no say in. We have to learn how to become revolutionary, from the starting point of having been born as objects, but when we assume that activism means making yourself an object or instrument useful for the goal of producing social change, then we are prohibiting exactly what we really want and need and the only thing that fuels macro social change anyway.\nTherefore, it stands to reason that the only possible first step toward transforming the currently existing social system is to create minimal spaces, with at least one other person, in which both parties serve absolutely no purpose. And the only way to create a zone in which all parties serve no other purpose is by committing to the only criterion than can possibly attune diverse atomized individuals: honesty. Honesty converts the most diverse individuals to the only unification that preserves all of their differences; everyone can be as radically different as they please, and yet attuned around the only thing they truly all share, namely, the objective fact that none are objects to any of the others but all are their own autonomous ends, that all are recognized as the creators of themselves, ultimately subordinate to nothing. If this feels uncmofortably “individualistic” for altruistic types, I need only remind you that this only works as a collective activity, and the truly autonomous individual immediately recognizes this individuality as a gift of the community. If this feels too simple or easy to be a serious revolutionary politics, I need only remind you that this is harder than you think, so accustomed we are to constantly calculate consequences. Yet it is only in this unique situation of purposelessness that one can exit the state of objecthood under capitalism, in order to experience, if only for a minute, what it feels like to be free. It is horrifying but I genuinely believe there are many people today who have never felt what I am talking about, because the constant mental chatter that is constantly calculating consequences has hijacked our experience of each other to such an extraordinary degree that we don’t even realize it.\nNobody wants to admit their mind and body are so fully hijacked (in part because people won’t like you, etc., i.e. the consequences), so we all continue this horrible state of things in which we actively push away from ourselves and others the only really desirable thing. The other reason I believe there exist many people who have never really grasped or cannot remember this experience is that, feeling or even remembering such an experience forces one to be a revolutionary. If you really know or remember this feeling, you cannot not find yourself foaming at the mouth in opposition to the absurdity, stupidity, and brutality of almost everything currently existing under the label of “reality.” That the average person appears to at least publicly speak and behave as if the offical reality is real—that is data supporting the inference that the very experience of true autonomous existing is itself going extinct. Or maybe everyone knows it, but we’re all too afraid to truly speak and act accordingly. Either way, the upshot is the same: revolutionary politics, in the first and perhaps even final analysis, means nothing other than the immanent production of autonomous communal social power through the basic principle of radical honesty, which implies immediate de-objectification followed by all parties becoming whatever they are (i.e. flourishing). By gaining a collective mastery over this production, how it works and how it breaks, we expand the commune indefinitely.\nIt is worth remembering that the world-historical revolution of capitalism itself, which overthrew feudalism, operated on precisely these terms. Whatever we might say about the inhumane consequences of capitalism, the pioneering individuals whose attitudes and behaviors would lead to generalized capitalist society were: highly creative, courageous individuals (in the sense of defying social expectations) who met in new and uncharted zones (the cities), who acted to manipulate the nature of reality by leveraging new forms of knowledge and new forms of technology that the traditional status quo repressed. They started in small groups, sometimes as individuals and sometimes in small networks of oath-bound individuals. Fearlessness, creativity, trust, and the purposeful alteration of social reality in a way that no one\u0026rsquo;s ever done before, produced a world-historical revolution. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason capitalism can’t be overthrown by the same type of operations, this time geared toward the the truth of our being rather than dishonest material interests in commanding nature and each other.\n4 Most of what most people do generates nothing but their own misery, and bad faith converts this misery into only a minimally tolerable survival (and even this minimum appears increasingly hard to maintain). Almost everything that passes for education today is essentially false. Most human relationships, at least in the overdeveloped world, range from empty to shit, as the number of our weak relationships has increased and the number of our deep relationships has decreased. And even the best benefits you can get from the status quo—if you\u0026rsquo;re really lucky, privileged, and/or do everything by the rules—don’t even give you that much security nowadays. These are some reasons why today, it is in some of our own lived relationships that we see not merely potential, but rather the site of currently unfolding revolutionary dynamics we are only beginning to decipher.\nI am writing this on the day that Donald Trump is being inaugurated as the President of the United States. There is something significant in the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking far more about Mark Fisher and my revolutionary friends than I am about Donald Trump and the government of the United States.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this long-standing assumption that educated, progressive individuals should pay close attention to national and international news, but if high-level politics and what is called the news are both institutionally and ideologically locked down to an unprecedented degree—as I would argue they are—then I believe that today, educated and progressive individuals will increasingly learn the courage to unhinge their attunement from what is effectively at this point mere noise in the social system. I think one of the discoveries some of us have been making recently is that, when you do this, in conjunction with doubling down on your attunement to dearest friends and comrades, so long as they are also honestly attuned to you, then fundamentally new energies emerge into this new collective entity-machine-project that feels quite literally out of this world. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean this in a woo-woo, spiritual way, I mean fundamental physiological, biochemical effects are triggered that then ripple out into speech and behaviors in organic ways tending to the overthrow of institutions.\nFor people who see short and easy proclamations on social media as the key gauge of someone\u0026rsquo;s political life, I am happy to give you 30 seconds to type that I think Donald Trump is very bad and, whatever it is, I\u0026rsquo;m against it. But I’m conserving my energy for larger projects; for my living, intimate accomplices and my revolutionary friends dead and alive. The big center is a massive, empty zone filled with little more than the fears of those who incorrectly believe there is still something there. Mark’s death is teaching me that, more and more I want to wager everything on my friends, and that means moving investments away from the big empty center of this dead society into the spaces, times, and experiences that you have the concrete ability to fill with power. None of this is an attack on other styles, it\u0026rsquo;s just to remind everyone that silence is not always complicity and indeed it is sometimes the mark of a groundswell you may just not know how to interpret.\nThat Mark and many of us have been onto something different, ever so slightly different but crucially, categorically different, is nicely measured by the reception of Mark’s infamous essay on the Vampire’s Castle. First, I think time has shown that essay to be way more correct than incorrect. I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry but anyone I know who has half-honestly watched the sociology of left internet discourse evolve over the past few years will agree on this point in private. Many remain afraid to say it, but with Mark’s passing this feels more important than ever to just put on the record. I remember following the whole fiasco when it happened, before I even knew Mark, and I thought it was absurd but I didn’t dare to say so. That’s shameful and embarrassing. Any self-respecting adult has to call bullshit wherever they honestly see bullshit, in public, without apologies. I know way too many people, myself included (although I’m trying to end this), who won’t say in public really important thoughts and feelings they have about various habits and tendencies prevalent in what passes for radical or progressive politics today. I won’t argue it here, because anyone who would be offended by what I’m suggesting almost certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be convinced and most people whose opinions and judgments I know and respect know what I’m talking about or at least accept and respect my comradely right to say what I think without apology. And here\u0026rsquo;s where this gets real: the truth is I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be writing this if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at this very moment embedded in real liberatory dynamics with others who I know have my back because they are themselves flying on the same winds.\nA little story I haven’t told many people. I have this draft book manuscript and Mark once invited me to share it with him. He was one of the first people I had ever shared it with, and honestly it is a pretty scrappy and highly idiosyncratic project that I could not have imagined appealing to anyone. But of course he loved it, or at least pretended to love it. His encouragement could not have come at a better time, it was a really long and dark period of nothing but rejections and failures on all other fronts, intellectual and personal. His interest in the book was maybe my most positive achievement I had in the entire year of 2014 – 2015. And again, where many people might only see a minor act of kindness, I think there is something much more substantial, if we can learn to see it.\nDispensing encouragement to younger people can be a world-transforming political action. And if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing that emerges from all of the beautiful tributes that have been written recently, Mark appears to have done this on an almost industrial scale. I was somewhat humbled to learn I am not so special, but impressed to learn that Mark appears to have been on some kind of mission to push forward everyone he possibly could. And you know what, lots of notable radicals or intellectuals or academics are nice people and they try their best to be \u0026ldquo;supportive\u0026rdquo; of others, but there are levels to this. This is where, if you look closely enough, you’ll see that people like Mark are not just kind or supportive; he was practicing a revolutionary politics much harder and far more interesting than just being kind.\nIf you meet someone you admire and they give you some general positive feedback or words of encouragement, the actual transforming effect is going to be conditional on a series of other factors. Typically, you might find it vaguely uplifting and inspiring for a little while. But when someone you admire goes to the same political meetings as you, and sits around before and after just like you, somewhat awkward, somewhat terrified of recent news, and personally, vulnerably desperate to change everything that currently exists, with you, well you know what? It changes everything. The effect is totally different, far more powerful, far more lasting. And it matters when radicals are also respected in more status quo hierarches—while of course there is so much to criticize about those hierarchies. When people such as Mark, who could be off writing cool books or seeking an academic promotion, are going to the same meetings as you because they genuinely want to make revolution now, it produces a unique effect. And I think that’s because no matter how radical we are, we cannot help but be affected differently depending on where a signal is coming from within the social status hierarchy. Placement in the social status hierarchy should mean nothing whatsoever for how we value or treat each other, my point is just that when people possess status quo cultural capital and they are choosing to invest themselves in the hard work of organized revolutionary politics, this is something relatively rare and it produces unique effects that deserve to be appreciated.\nIt is these types of interpersonal activities that generate irrevocable anthropological transformations. Mark\u0026rsquo;s interest in my book was not just “encouraging”—it effectively supported my entire will for almost a year at a time when so many rejections were really making me wonder whether I was maybe just dumb or crazy. But also it altered the course of my life, to make me more invested in the real, immediate actualization of revolutionary political change, because our relationship was one defined by a revolutionary organization and if I felt indebted to Mark’s support what that really meant was I was indebted to keep figuring out how to make revolution. I\u0026rsquo;m fully aware how absurd this might sound to others, but think about it. Since that time, I’ve had some modest academic success in my bullshit bourgeois career, which means my precious ego and income are pretty secure at the moment, so this is exactly when most people start to drift from their youthful radical politics toward a comfortable integration with the status quo. I have every social, financial, and cultural reason to now just kick back and enjoy my permanent academic post. But now I can\u0026rsquo;t do that, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy I can\u0026rsquo;t do that, but the reason is because through my revolutionary friends I am increasingly and irrevocably indebted to figuring out how to make revolution—to pursue my own liberation means pursuing the liberation of those others who are the concrete, direct generators of the power that has animated me over the past two years.\nThis is what we are onto. True attention and care, radical honesty and making shared/public that which is hidden, not to make a watered-down life possible within unlivable conditions but as a necessary path to making true life occur now. The politics of \u0026ldquo;consciousness-raising” is the material process of overthrowing oppressive political institutions at the only point they really exist (where they enter our bodies), by treating each other honestly and never as instruments, thereby generating irrevocably bonded yet autonomous agents and collectives incapable of being consistent with status quo institutions. In my tiny little corner of contemporary Western radical politics, this is exactly what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing with Mark and a number of others.\n5 Something about all of the lovely tributes that has given me pause is the tendency to see Mark with somewhat rose-tinted glasses. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Mark was a first-class intellect, an excellent writer, and he made quite an impact on a sizable audience. Many people knew Mark and his work much better than I do, but from where I\u0026rsquo;m sitting I don\u0026rsquo;t even see Mark as primarily a writer. To me, Mark was an active revolutionary first and foremost, he just happened to write a lot of things down. I think this is really important because, how do you think anyone becomes an important writer? It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not by choosing to become an important writer; it is by having some above-average source of interest or energy toward certain questions and writing things down along the way because you need to make sense of things as you go. Personally, I think Mark was interested in how such a rotten set of institutions can perpetuate themselves, and of course the question of how to overthrow them. I see his writings as by-products of the much larger qualities, attitudes and behaviors that made Mark the uniquely important figure he was.\nIn a comradely way, I would even wonder if there is not something possibly ideological in some of the glowing obituaries of Mark as a writer. As if his obscure, independent k-punk blog became so valuable and influential because of his way with words? I doubt that. And if you want to grow up to be cool and valuable and influential then just start an obscure, independent blog with good words? Maybe, but I think the real reason Mark made a lasting contributon to late 20th century British culture is because he fucking hated capitalism and it was killing him and he actually dared to say so, and to explain how and why, and to actively find others with whom he might take an honest shot at changing everything. If that\u0026rsquo;s the type of person you are, if that\u0026rsquo;s how you live, then anything you scribble on the back of a napkin is going to be fascinating, inspiring, useful, and impressive. Not because you\u0026rsquo;re a good \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rdquo; but almost the opposite, because you care so much more about seeking liberation than being a successful \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rdquo; that you have the freedom and energy to do something real with words. This is a crucial lesson for those interested in pursuing their own path of radical cultural production, but it’s one that tends to be erased in the tropes our cultural industry uses to describe important writers.\nNo doubt I liked and admired Mark’s writings, but I think Mark would understand my wish to make clear that he was not some sort of super rare genius talent. He wasn’t: he was you. Of course he was smart, and a good writer, but he was also weird and awkward and nervous, like you, like me. I have met certain towering intellects whose mental function is in fact probably something incomparable to what you and I have. Mark was not that type, he was something far more dangerous. He would often say interesting and brilliant things and also things I hardly understood or did not agree with or did not find interesting. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard people call him a great speaker, and he was certainly quite a speaker, but “great speaker” risks a crucial misunderstanding. He was great fun to listen to and talk with, but he was not a great speaker in the classic sense most people associate with that phrase. He was often quite disorganized, mentally cluttered, elliptical, stuttering, longwinded, and—if we are being honest, and of course we are—sometimes downright incomprehensible.\nI remember at a Plan C Congress he gave a talk on some ideas from Operaismo and I left the room with almost no idea what he was trying to say. But the radical insight here is that that can be more politically powerful and sometimes even more fun and cool than \u0026ldquo;great speakers.\u0026rdquo; This is exactly the political-psychological mechanics of punk, where it is a lack of certain skills combined with a kind of passionate carelessness that triggers real excitement and empowerment in others, more so than mastery. So to call Mark a \u0026ldquo;great speaker\u0026rdquo; risks the very same media-spectacle recuperation that pacified Punk. I\u0026rsquo;m overjoyed to see Mark becoming a legend even sooner than I would\u0026rsquo;ve predicted, given the remarkable outpouring of acclaim in the aftermath of his death. But if the effect is to increase the perceived cognitive or performative distance between the average reader and Mark, then that would be unfortunate. What made Mark so interesting and powerful was that he thought what he thought, and he said what he said, because he wanted to, because he was irrepressibly moved to overthrow an intolerable state of things. And he said what he said despite that he had all of the shortcomings and deficiencies of the average person. To hear someone like Mark think all this radical shit, and make all these crazy statements, was so politically electrifying exactly because he was not super gifted and had to struggle against obvious normal difficulties. But he didn\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck, because he was a revolutionary, and that could be you tomorrow, today.\nOr consider what is probably his most famous work, Capitalist Realism. It\u0026rsquo;s a totally cool little book that\u0026rsquo;s fun to read and I think it was really useful to a lot of people. But it’s crucial to celebrate it for the right reasons, and avoid those that distort Mark’s unique powers. It was not super original, certainly not systematic or comprehensive, and it gave very little direction on what any of us should do next. Mark wasn’t a genius, he was an interested, passionate, creative person on a search for something real, and that’s so much more revolutionary than mere genius. Again, his work was something you could do, if only you could find the courage and energy to pay attention to what really interests you, and write down what you think, for your friends, precisely without really giving a fuck if its original or systematic or impressive. This is the secret recipe of radical culture that actually produces effects on people, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure Mark would not mind me reminding people of this.\nFrom my view, I think Mark had a few key insights and I would summarize them as follows. All of this is temporary and it’s not supposed to be like this, but if you look closely you can always find glimmers of life. And it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to find those glimmers of life and invest in them, and if we all do this honestly and openly than we can and will find a way to change everything. These insights are insights that many of us have deep down inside, he just went after them as if it were a matter of life and death, because it was a matter of life and death, just as it is for us today, whether we feel like facing it now or later.\n6 Mark\u0026rsquo;s death is teaching me that our revolutionary moment today is so much more real than I thought. Not an abstract potential, but something that is already operating wherever radically true relationships are being formed, if you only know how to pay attention, be honest with yourself and others, and invest your energies wisely. The more you take your attention and energies away from status quo fixations, and divert them into those people genuinely attuned to liberation, then as the dynamics of genuine bonding and belonging take hold, larger collectives can be spun from the two, to the three, and so on. If Mark\u0026rsquo;s readers trust him as an authority on the political nature of depression, then we should also trust him as an authority on the real and immediately available road to revolutionary transformation that he and I and others have been stumbling down together for the past few years.\nThere’s nothing magical or sacred about Plan C, which is only one particular group trying to figure these things out; it\u0026rsquo;s about the discoveries many people are making and are continuing to make, discoveries which anyone can pursue in their own way and on their own terms with anyone around them. This is not a vague appeal for everyone to “come together in love” with everyone around them, not that at all: it is an appeal to break away from all that is wrong and false with ony those you can trust to make of yourselves whatever it is you need to make of yourselves in order that life may occur together now. Not a universal love, but a highly careful and discriminating love—which might very well produce some enemies in the short term—based rigorously only on those principles you honestly believe to produce real dynamics of liberation, and an unflinching refusal of anything else. Not a circle of people singing kumbaya, but a real uprising that honestly feels like an uprising and which creates, almost out of thin air, the very thing you have been seeking all along.\nAt least for me, this is how it’s working. It\u0026rsquo;s sad to say, but it might\u0026rsquo;ve been Mark’s death that has really driven this home to me once and for all. During my last visit to the Plan C group in London, I had the good fortune of spending some quality time with several of my closest friends in that group. In a few moments, spread throughout my visit, I had the distinct feeling that, with those people, I\u0026rsquo;m truly embedded in a life or death struggle, but at the same time, in those very moments, I felt fully 100% alive and doing exactly what I was supposed to be doing. You can’t call it liberation or revolution exactly, because no one is liberated until everyone is liberated, but it was a really unique and overpowering quality or experience of life that I used to think was something that would only come after the revolution, as it were. In these moments I sincerely felt like it was already here, or presently swelling like a wave, like it was actually happening in my body, like we are really doing the only thing that revolution could possibly be: our radically honest best, together. Interestingly, the only time I can remember having this feeling was in the headiest days of Occupy. The reason this is remarkable, and more evidence that indeed we are onto something, is that feelings of revolutionary power are supposedly short-term, fleeting, unsustainable rushes that only come about in rare insurrectionary upsurges such as Occupy—but here I am feeling them in a random pub with E, in another pub with N and A and J and W, on the overground to Tottenham with S, with C and T and A and J and A and S and everyone else at the same Misty Moon where I first met Mark Fisher before a Plan C meeting in 2014. And I still feel them right now, weeks later, even though to the naked eye “nothing is happening.”\nIn a way that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have said even two weeks ago, it really now does seem to me that we are already doing it. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen it so clearly. I do not feel any hope for the future, which I firmly believe is a conservative affect. What I have is an interpretation of where I am and what is going on around me and who exactly are these different people. And I have increasing reasons to believe that my interpretation is true, while the socially dominant interpretation is false. What I also have are concrete tools, reproducible tactics and techniques to make energies flow inside our bodies, tactics I have discovered with my revolutionary friends, whether we have fully realized it or not, tactics that I can now creatively employ to remake every part of the world that I touch. What’s even more remarkable is a peculiar strategic assymetry about these tactics: these are tools that only real revolutionaries can learn, for the simple reason that today one must enter a revolutionary attitude to even access certain basic human experiences prohibited by what is currently called normalcy. Not least of these basic experiences is the one I mentioned above regarding “consciousness-raising,” that most primordial experience of being present with others for no ulterior purpose whatsoever.\nThat simple and immediately available place of radical honesty and being-unto-ourselves, easy as it sounds, is available only to individuals and groups able to see that it is effectively barred to normal humans adapted to the status quo. Also it is only through radical relationships, attuned and bonded around the honest search for liberation, that currently atomized individuals can gain the courage to take the risks necessary for shooting down this path. When I speak of risks I don’t mean anything grand, I mean even just that blog post you’ve been meaning to write but for some reason you’re just vaguely afraid to post. With honestly revolutionary friends, you stop caring what the Big Other will think, and you say a little more, do a little more, than you normally would—because you actually believe you’re onto something, as your friends are onto it also, and you might be crazy or stupid but you can’t all be crazy and stupid.\nLast but not least, you begin to realize that even if everything fails and everything goes wrong, nobody can really touch you, because the truth is most people won’t even know what you’re talking about. At first one’s fear is always that people will respond negatively and punish you for sticking your neck out, but as you learn to do so, buoyed by revolutionary friends, you realize something at once more horrifying and liberating: you are much more likely to be ignored or misunderstood, possibly forever, than maligned and punished. If you’re honest path brings malice against you then you should count yourself lucky, for it means you are certainly onto something. See the Vampire’s Castle. Of course you could also be veering toward evil, always a risk, but again that’s why you’ve invested so much into your revolutionary friends. They will keep you honest without oppressing you.\nAnd let me tell you one of the most beautiful things. If I haven\u0026rsquo;t made myself clear or you just don\u0026rsquo;t understand what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, I am sorry about that but I also don\u0026rsquo;t need to care or worry because I know with certainty that at least a few of my comrades will. I\u0026rsquo;m able to know this with certainty because the only reason I\u0026rsquo;m able to write this is because of them, so almost by definition they will find themselves in it. Radical political groups are often mocked for being self-referential little spheres, but the only reason this is mock-worthy is because we feel like we have to be accountable to something or someone else outside of those circles. So the inside of those circles can feel sad and guilty and lacking something. What exactly are they lacking, though? Nobody can ever say. We feel like we need to do something more, or do something bigger or better outside of ourselves, and we mock ourselves for being tiny and self-referential only because we judge ourselves from the perspective of some stranger in the big dead center who in fact is not looking at us, and never looks at us. Ironically, the really perverse thing about our little circles is that they are not radically circular enough.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with a small group that makes time and space to see nothing but itself. But the crucial condition for this to become revolutionary, the condition which is so hard to meet, is that such a circle must dare to make its own judgments about what is true and not true, real and not real (not in the sense of one objective truth but in the sense of diverse honesties or consciences), without apology and without paranoia and with absolutely zero respect for the millions of idiotic responses that might come from the massive dead center of society. And then it must dare to really believe and live by those judgments. The capacity to generate charmed circles is an extraordinary political power. All that is necessary from there is to make that circle expandable with a scalable membrane, not to self-loathe the inherently circular nature of a shared world, constantly fearing that we are not already enough for each other.\n","date":1485475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569101822,"objectID":"990e683da6e181a70209aafba752fe46","permalink":"/blog/2017/01/27/mark-fisher-and-my-revolutionary-friends/","publishdate":"2017-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2017/01/27/mark-fisher-and-my-revolutionary-friends/","section":"post","summary":"If you think revolution is impossible, you are looking in the wrong places.","tags":["radical politics","life","liberation","activism"],"title":"“I Think We're Really Onto Something:” Mark Fisher and My Revolutionary Friends","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569629123,"objectID":"2056df54fa1c0e7ae5c57936a3dab596","permalink":"/project/based-deleuze/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/based-deleuze/","section":"project","summary":"Short book. ~22k words (90 pages).","tags":["Other Life"],"title":"Based Deleuze","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In one week, you\u0026rsquo;ll publish your first data-driven blog post — and gain your first readers.

Some of the video has been translated and re-presented by a couple of artists named Silvia Maglioni and Graeme Thomson, in an on-going project called Through the Letterbox. In a recent showing at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, I got to watch a set of clips with English subtitles.\nThe videos were extraordinary. My French would not have been nearly good enough to get much from them had it not been for the subtitles. But the subtitles felt very well done. He is very intense and improvisational but faster and less self-important than someone like Lacan.\nSince it felt like quite a rare privilege to watch these lectures—and as far as I can find, these particular clips with subtitles are not currently available online—I took some fairly detailed notes.\nI am pretty sure it is fair to say these may be some of the only notes in English on this particular set of lectures in 1975-76.\nPresumably thanks to the curation, these clips were highly condensed around some of the most important and productive points in Deleuze’s perspective. Some ideas which in the books are very difficult are here made really quite simple; to a degree that is quite remarkable and, I think, almost surprisingly useful and helpful—especially from a political perspective.\nBelow I attach some fairly unedited notes. Minor personal comments are in square brackets.\nYou can’t derive a bridge from a filiation\nFiliation would ruin everything, would only be connecting kingdoms\nBridge is a term of alliance\nMicromultiplicities:\n Communication between two completely separate lines\n A virus connects different series which do not therefore become one (i.e., a bridge rather than a filiation)\n So connections between separate lines create multiplicities\n  swarm of black holes is different than a molar ensemble because each is emitter and receiver, no hierarchical structure.\n[Here he is turning to the question of how you can link up several micromultiplicities, the question of “good” or perhaps we might say desirable scaling-up and aggregation, as opposed to “bad” (hierarchy and domination). He does not explain what he means by black hole but it’s elaborated at length in Mille Plateaux. In short, I read it as a void at the center of all structures, a kind of perhaps necessary anchoring point but one which typically comes to be associated with illusory meanings and conservative collective investments. He also calls it the “face,” which I think is related to how the face is the black hole of modern, narcissistic-individualistic bourgeois subjectivity (it anchors so much meaning for us and is yet ultimately empty). I would say the “black hole” or “face” is quite similar to what Lacan has in mind with his concept of the point de capiton, but I’m not an expert. In any event, in this opaque last point he is basically saying that a micromultiplicity of black holes is in less danger of fascistic regression because no particular black hole has any more power than another. There is also a connotation, I think, of relative transparency (the language of communication), as compared to the black holes of molar multiplicities, as below.]\nIn any molar multiplicitly, something, another nature is slipping in\nThrowing down bridges, connecting new loops and networks\nHow is a multiplicity defined?\nMolar multiplicity = structuring principle that is not given as such\nBut crafty multiplicities, discreet multiplicities that insinuate themselves, that’s not a structuring principle (talked about this last year)\nThere are a number of dimensions. But how do we understand how many? They have a maximal dimension. This is where it gets interesting\n[He really emphasizes this last point. He is very excited about it.]\nThe maximum dimension possible. That is it.\nThe maximum dimension is called the border, and that is where we are saved.\nInstead of a secret organizing principle, like in molar ensembles\nTake a “fly” or “frog” multiplicity, or a mosquito multiplicity. Finally, remaining in science instead of literature. One fly means nothing. A single fly is lost, aka not a fly. All that means anything is “flies”. A wolf means nothing. A lone wolf means nothing, but if it’s the border wolf then that’s different.\nMoby Dick: the border\nThe border animal is always a monster, that’s important\nPower apparatuses\nMicromultiplicity is a molecular multiplicity, a swarm, aleatory\nEvery mosquito is the border, all can see the others in space\nThe limit is to have all mosquitos to the right, for instance, at which point they tend to back in. Stability is assured in case of catastrophe.\nThe border: the line in function of which you see all others on the other side\nTake advantage of being on the border\nIt means being part of the gang, while not being in it\nOutside then re-entering\nIs it Morphogensis by Thom, or Morphogenology?\n[I think he is asking Guattari in the audience, or suggesting that Guattari be consulted or something, not sure. In any event he is referring to Structural Stability and Morphogenesis by René Thom.]\nIn Mrs. Dalloway, Virginia Woolf’s molar problems are solved by a walk. No longer the same scale. A fantastic molecular walk sweeps away the molar problems, e.g. to remain man or woman, to marry or not, molar problems. A small particle makes all this explode.\nDuring her walk among taxis; taxis are semi-aleatory\nShe slices like a “knife through everything”\n“I am a mist”, she says. That’s a molecular multiplicity\n“A mist laid out among the people I know”\nAnd at the same time, I am on the outside\nHow is that possible? It’s odd, you cant describe that as a molar thing\nThey will say “it’s only literature”, “you’re either outside or inside.” You’re either one of us or you’re out, or you’ve been placed on sentry duty. Or there is a series of binary choices…\nThey will say “you can’t say that” (like logical postivism).\nBut we can awake particles, and nobody can deny that. “But of course, this is how I live.”\nA particle that is always on the border of the multiplicity it belongs to\nBut it can be any particle whatsoever, like mosquitos, or it can be a monster mosquito, Moby Dick, head wolf. If you find the border, you’ll know how many dimensions the multiplicity has. If you dont keep to the border, you are stuck in the molar.\nA rapport between lines of flight and border, perhaps the border is a path. The particles on the border stabilize. Temporary stabilizer. Local, but not only. It also lets the mult slip into another. It is stabilized, but also puts the border near others, and allows them to transform. Thresholds or doors from one border to another, below a threshold, the border defines the local stabliizer. Above it, there is tranformation into the other. A slippage of borders, an overcoming of thresholds. No ramified arborescent schema can do that. “Sol-gel,” from state of solution to a gel. The solution state is a kind of multiplicity, the gel is another.\nHow does a border pass the threshold? The percolation threshold. You can’t do this with an aborescent model.\n[I put in my notes, “This really matters for how we see the wealthy, the politicos, etc. We tend to see them as powerful and in control but I really think nearly the opposite, and I have been trying to think harder about what it means if we take that very seriously. I think Deleuze is helping to explain that the powerful are not in control but really they are stuck more than anyone, at least in one special sense; they couldn’t change themselves or their environments even if they wanted to or tried, because they are so in the center of the molar ensembles, they are indeed only those who have been most fully sucked into the molar black hole.]\nThe bordering particles have to change nature, “that’s key”\nSpecies or types dont matter to evolutionary theorists, only populations\nDebts, counter-debts: these are bonds\nAll individual lines on their own terms\nThreateend by massification or leadership on the inside, or group oedipus, like gender roles\nGangs are molecular multiplicities\nThen they are threatened by the molar, like how nomads become states\nThe point is that the individuals go out, they bring back the loot, and redistribute it. But it’s always on individuals terms. There are debts and alliances, etc.\n[To be clear, I think he is saying “it’s always on individual terms” as if it’s a good thing; i.e. autonomy.]\nBut black holes can emerge on the inside of a gang; the issue is to not slip over into the molar.\nMolar ensembles are organized around black holes or the face; it organizes the center by organizing ambitions, all the underlings try to enter the center, because those are the careers which are legitimated; the value and reality of different goals are decided by the structuring of the moral ensembles, it sucks everything in as a black hole does.\n[I think it was my own note here, that I wrote: “A constant sucking up of our attention. I don’t remember him using the word “attention” so I think that was me, but it could have been him, I forget.]\nExcept the sentrys who are charged with guarding\nThe outsider can come from nowhere, overspilling the border, the unnameable thing, a swarm of one\nThe leader of a molecular multiplicity, they are inherently on a border. As in animal packs, a central leader, and someone who pushes, surveys, the great nomad; only emporers stay in the center.\nThe question is always what kind of leader: a border-dweller occupying postion of outsider, or a “champion” of centralized power, a face.\n","date":1448150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560910239,"objectID":"045650439e3b76fec8bfb4d916910c1b","permalink":"/blog/2015/11/22/notes-on-rare-deleuze-lectures/","publishdate":"2015-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2015/11/22/notes-on-rare-deleuze-lectures/","section":"post","summary":"Notes I took on rare video of Gilles Deleuze lecturing in 1975-76.

This increased demand for skilled workers, ceteris paribus, increases their income relative to unskilled workers. It is widely agreed that this is a key explanation for at least some of the rapid increase in income inequality since the 1980s.1 One key observation consistent with this theory is that it is only after the appearance of micro-computers that income inequality begins to rise in the early 1980s.2 A second key observation is that more educated workers are more likely to use a computer on the job3.\nDespite this growing interest in the economic implications of technological change, social scientists have failed to take seriously a surprisingly similar line of thought advanced most notably in twentieth-century German philosophy. Heidegger and, later, the Frankfurt School theorists developed critical theories of technology which argued, in different ways, that technological changes shape ethical attitudes toward the world. In particular, a specific line of thought revolves around the relationship between technological development and instrumental rationality, or in other words formal analytical rationality which renounces consideration of substantive goals and concerns itself only with calculating the optimal means toward given ends.\nFor Heidegger, from a phenomenological perspective, technology represents a \u0026ldquo;clearing\u0026rdquo; of Being which generates a relation to the world in which nature and other humans are merely \u0026ldquo;standing-reserve\u0026rdquo; waiting to be exploited as means to whatever ends. For Adorno, Horkheimer, and especially Marcuse, modern technological advancements were \u0026ldquo;organizing and perpetuating (or changing) social relationships, a manifestation of prevalent thought and behavior patterns, an instrument for control and domination.”4\nWhile positivist social scientists have long perceived these types of claims from continential social theory to be hopelessly speculative and empirically intractable, this is puzzling given that the core claim emerging from this particular current in the critical theory of technology is relatively straightforward: technological development increases the prevalence of instrumentalism among other possible ethical attitudes toward the world. Moreover, the theory of skill-biased technological change is a powerful heuristic for modeling this argument given that it is a well-established model of how technology can generate unequal distributions of power without any reference to Marxian bugaboos which have likely caused more confusion than clarity by now.5\nHowever, it is perhaps more fair to observe that critical theorists indeed sometimes lack what contemporary social scientists would call “mechanisms,\u0026rdquo; or specifiable and testable triggers which effectively do the work of some variable X supposedly causing some variable Y. While this particular critique of technological development is not delivered with any particular \u0026ldquo;mechanism\u0026rdquo; which would be intelligible to many empirical social scientists working today, critical theory does supply many useful hints in this direction. Moreover, the basic argument is surprisingly consistent with well-known economic models, however disparate might be the vocabularies, thus permitting the elaboration of a critical theory of technological change empirically testable and consistent with a rational-choice framework.\nA Theory To better specify the mechanism whereby technological change may plausibly generate a greater prevalence of instrumental ethics, I propose a theory of ethically-biased technological change. I argue that certain technological changes can increase the income paid to certain ethical orientations relative to others. As in the theory of skill-biased technological change, certain technological changes increase the productivity of certain ethical orientations relative to others, increasing their relative demand, and therefore increasing their relative income. This increase in relative income represents a premium paid to those with the ethical resources required by the new technology, just as skill-biased technological change generates a premium paid to those with the technical resources required by the new technology.6\nMore specifically, a technological change which increases productivity but transgresses any particular ethical value will increase the productivity of individuals with the weakest commitment to that ethical value relative to those more firmly committed to that ethical value, thus increasing demand for them relative to the more ethical individuals, and thereby increasing their relative income. Ethically transgressive technological innovations increase the productivity of the least ethical because ethical compunctions are effectively a psychological tax on a worker. It is hard to take a job, and then demoralizing to work it, to the degree one feels ethical compunction for doing so. While an employer would have to pay very high wages to attract highly ethical workers to an ethically transgressive job, the wages they have to pay to attract relatively unethical workers will tend to be lower. The firmer one\u0026rsquo;s ethical commitment, the greater is the tax one pays to work an ethically transgressive job, the less worthwhile the wage, and the less likely is one to take the job; the weaker one\u0026rsquo;s ethical commitment, the lower is the tax, the more worthwhile is the wage, and the more likely one is to take the job. The overall implication is that technological change rewards individuals with weak ethical convictions relative to individuals with strong ethical convictions, and therefore exerts a direct, material pressure on the evolution of ethics within society.\nThere are three key, testable implications we would expect to observe if this model indeed captures important aspects of the historical record. First, during times of ethically transgressive technological innovation, the first workers will be individuals who before the technological innovation were already less ethically scrupulous on the relevant ethical dimension. Second, workers of the new technology will be paid a premium which would be, in principle, distinct from any skill premium, although of course these can be correlated. Third, if we add the assumption of modern capitalist institutions, wherein wage workers have no common land and no immediate means of production, then the price of integrity for committedly ethical individuals literally becomes death. This last implication means that, if technological change is ethically biased as I hypothesize, the steady-state to which it must tend in the long-run is the absolute evacuation of integrity from all participants in the labor market. Note that this can come about through two different causal pathways: ethical individuals can learn to sacrifice their integrity to compete with the unethical and survive, and/or ethical individuals can literally die off while unethical individuals thrive and replace them (evolutionary change). It should be noted explicitly that while observations 1 and 2 show how ethically-biased technological change reward certain ethical orientations differently and unequally,\nAnecdotally, a general acquaintenace with the contours of modern history seems to suggest some striking evidence for this model of ethically-biased technology change. Consider, for instance, that while a certain amount of philosophical liberalism was no doubt necessary for the industrial revolution to emerge, and this perhaps explains why it began in England, it seems equally undeniable that the industrial revolution in turn generated an extraordinary instrumental turn and valorization of self-interest wherever it went. It will obviously require more work to test this expectation more rigorously, but it seems highly probable.\nConclusion In summary, building from insights of the Frankfurt School, I provide a specific, empirically testable mechanism which accounts for the large-scale historical variations in ethical outlook they described to the dismissal of the mainstream social scientists of the time. Working heuristically from rational-choice economic theory, my stylized theoretical model is consistent with but more general than the rational-choice framework because the model here in some sense explains what rational-choice models merely assume (the prevalance of instrumentally rational dispositions).\nIf correct, the long-run, world-historical implication of this model could not be more staggering for understanding the ethical experience of living through modern, let alone contemporary, capitalism: if this model is correct, then it would mean that today we have inherited a world in which ethical integrity has been subjected to a roughly 300-500 year forced evacuation by labor market institutions.\n See Card, David, and John E DiNardo. 2002. “Skill Biased Technological Change and Rising Wage Inequality: Some Problems and Puzzles” and Guvenen, Fatih, and Burhanettin Kuruscu. 2010. “A Quantitative Analysis of the Evolution of the U.S. Wage Distribution, 1970–2000.” NBER Macroeconomics Annual 24(1): 227–76. ^ Katz, Lawrence F. 2002. “Technological Change, Computerization, and the Wage Structure.” In Understanding the Digital Economy Data, Tools, and Research, Cambridge: MIT Press. ^ Autor, David H, Lawrence F Katz, and Alan B Krueger. 1997. “Computing Inequality: Have Computers Changed the Labor Market?” ^ Marcuse, H. 1941. “Some Social Implications of Modern Technology.” Studies in Philosophy and Social Science, Vol. IX. ^ I have in mind such perennial bad habits as lazily but self-certainly referring to Capital as a conspiratorial agent, an argument which has never boded very well for Marxism. ^ Indeed, the analogy between skill-biased and ethically-biased technological change is all the more apt if we, with Foucault, conceptualize the practice of ethos as itself a kind of technical game; if ethical resources are themselves understood as technologies of the self. Key examples in this context are those most bourgeois of ethical resources: the various techniques of repressing ethical compunctions and moral anxieties, and the various techniques of guilt management consequently required by this ethos. In this register, ethically-biased technological change would be essentially identical to skill-biased technological with the exception that the \u0026ldquo;skills\u0026rdquo; in question are the skills of self-management rather than economic production. The reason we must avoid this reductionism at the outset is that it would beg the most important question, namely, the question regarding how exactly did the contemporary human become, quite peculiar in the long-run of world history, so instrumentalist that the only activities remaining in contemporary life are exploiting and suffering exploitation? ^   ","date":1403308800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560910239,"objectID":"1d4dee02fe4153e1cc19dcf697d7e8a5","permalink":"/blog/2014/06/21/a-theory-of-ethically-biased-technological-change-toward-an-empirical-test-of-the-frankfurt-school/","publishdate":"2014-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2014/06/21/a-theory-of-ethically-biased-technological-change-toward-an-empirical-test-of-the-frankfurt-school/","section":"post","summary":"Critical theory is often perceived as anti-scientific but the Frankfurt School theorists advanced many hypotheses amenable to empirical testing.","tags":["social science","Frankfurt School","Marcuse","Adorno","Horkheimer","technology","pacification","mechanisms"],"title":"A theory of ethically-biased technological change (toward an empirical test of the Frankfurt School)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["theory \u0026 empirics"],"content":"Early theorists in modern political science had high hopes for using new survey techniques to analyze the individual-level psychological and behavorial processes which constitute modern liberal democracy. Berelson (1952), for instance, noted that democratic theory assumes that citizens meet certain requirements related to tolerance, patience, interest, knowledge, and the will to participate. See also the famous book Voting (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954).\nBut early research in political behavior was bleak. Seminal citations for this view are The American Voter (Campbell et al. 1960) and Converse (1964). Most people were found to have little knowledge of politics, most political opinions were not based on facts, most people were generally authoritarian and prejudiced, they typically only listened to views they already agreed with, and participation in politics was low (Prothro and Grigg 1960; McCloskey 1964; Cobb and Elder 1971, 893). In short, much of this first wave of political science research, largely based on the new survey methods growing popular at the time, would have seemed damning evidence that the citizens of the United States\u0026rsquo; simply do not constitute what is called democracy.\nRather than take these studies as ammunition to protest the US political system\u0026ndash;and perhaps joining the students, the blacks, and the women who at this very time were doing precisely this\u0026ndash;the next wave of political scientists simply argued that early theorists of democracy had too narrow a definition of democracy. The new idea was that \u0026ldquo;democracy\u0026rdquo; only requires an empirical relationship between public opinion and policymaking in the aggregate. If the actual direction of state policymaking were to show zero correlation with shifts in public opinion, this would be damning evidence that what the public wants has no affect on the policies pursued by state elites. But so long as policymaking in general moves in response to aggregate public opinion, this is adequate evidence that the \u0026ldquo;macropolity\u0026rdquo; is indeed a functioning democracy. And indeed, since then, political scientists have found that in democracies, shifts in public opinion tend to be followed by corresponding shifts in policymaking. Many scholars interpert these findings as evidence that democratic institutions deliver what they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to: mass public control over the general direction of national policymaking.\nAs scholars pointed out even at the time, it is a very conservative move to solve the problem of undemocratic realities by simply weakening the definition of democracy (Easton 1969; Walker 1966; Bachrach 1967). I\u0026rsquo;m interested in specifying and, in the future, measuring and testing two specific aspects of this politically and therefore scientifically problematic move.\n1.) I hypothesize that a crucial unjustified problem at this moment in political science, a theoretical and empirical problem never yet adequately addressed and which bears extraordinary significance for true popular social change, is that what people express as their opinion is significantly determined by what the status quo institutions at that moment will permit. This is because in general, people do not express political demands for policy changes which they believe are impossible given the institutional landscape. Such an articulation is seen as stupid, naive, or simply meaningless, so individuals calculate and articulate their political desires in a way that effectively assumes the institutional status quo as given. In this way, discourse on the level of \u0026ldquo;public opinion\u0026rdquo; (e.g., asking people questions about what a current government should do) contains an \u0026ldquo;approval\u0026rdquo; of the status quo which is not real but is simply assumed into their answer by the nature of the question. Political science since this period essentially imputes to citizens a baseline level of \u0026ldquo;support\u0026rdquo; for a status quo which is really nothing more than their degree of capitulation to a status quo which (variably and contingently) presents itself as given and unmovable. These two components\u0026ndash;sincere approval of the status quo and mere compliance with power (the very nature of which is to be taken as given)\u0026ndash;have never been adequately disaggregated. Public opinion has only ever been, from its beginning, a measured aggregate response to questions which are generated in part by an unmeasured quantum of political force.\nIn this light, we might begin to hypothesize that political practices such as delegation, the proliferation of subnational and/or supranational bureacracies charged with certain policymaking imperatives and/or prohibitions, have more to do with public opinion than is typically thought. For instance, the European Commission was designed to be the \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo; of European integration precisely because it would be insulated from the snags of domestic resistances. We might hypothesize that the establishment of a bureaucratically insulated policymaking institution such as the EC (or any other sub- or supra-national institution which removes a portion of policymaking power from democratic control) lowers the salience of certain public opinion questions and/or decreases the tendency of citizens to articulate certain approvals or disapprovals. Political scientists such as Timothy Hellwig have shown that citizens do indeed discount their judgments of the political landscape based on exogenous changes such as economic globalization, but this logic ought to apply to any institutional change with any effect on what it is possible for certain actors to do or not do. Specifically, purposeful institutional innovations might have the effect of ameliorating citizens negative judgments of certain actors or other previously existing institutions, or perhaps they might diffuse blame across so many institutions that citizens no longer feel dissatisfied with any of them. More specifically in our example, the advent of the EC might weaken citizens\u0026rsquo; negative judgments of domestic policymakers, if they believe domestic policymakers have a weaker institutional role in setting policy than before the advent of the EC.\nResearchers will have to disaggregate these \u0026ldquo;authentic-individual\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;forced-institutional\u0026rdquo; components of public opinion data before we can take them seriously as reflections of genuine support or disapproval of the political status quo.\n2.) Another extraordinary threat to this already conservative rationalization of contemporary public policymaking is the possibility that public opinion is itself determined by political and economic elites. For, of course, if changes in public opinion were found to be determined by status quo political factors not democratically determined (distinct from and in addition to the baseline bias caused by institutions, outlined above), then even robust correlations between aggregate public opinion and policymaking could no longer be taken seriously as evidence of democracy.\nThis is the claim of critics such as David Harvey. They point to the 1970s as a crucial period. The example of Lewis Powell\u0026rsquo;s memo to the US Chamber of Commerce (Harvey 2005, 43). The Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers began a significant and documented intensification of its spending, lobbying, and membership. The Business Roundtable is founded in 1972. Corporate interests start funding a large group of think-tanks and academic institutions as well. NBER is an example. The Trilateral commission in 1973, the report by political scientists called \u0026ldquo;The Crisis of Democracy.\u0026rdquo; Nozick, Milton Freedom on TV. Of course, this remains to be demonstrated very convincingly in the quantitative literature, but I should like to try.\nBut even the mainstream \u0026ldquo;public policy\u0026rdquo; literature testifies to the fact that \u0026ldquo;political marketing\u0026rdquo; has as much to do with selling political products, i.e. producing political ideas, as gauging what citizens demand (Lees-Marshment 2011, 9). They quite openly and uncontroversially use techniques of manipulation, taken from advertising and marketing. So it is hardly a fringe left-wing idea that public opinion is the object as much as it is the subject of policymakers.\n","date":1392422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560910239,"objectID":"fb1360b1e94562d64bb7dcddfd8d7451","permalink":"/blog/2014/02/15/some-questions-about-the-opinion-policy-link/","publishdate":"2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2014/02/15/some-questions-about-the-opinion-policy-link/","section":"post","summary":"Early theorists in modern political science had high hopes for using new survey techniques to analyze the individual-level psychological and behavorial processes which constitute modern liberal democracy.

Is someone’s life very consistent with what the status quo expects of them, or is it very inconsistent. What proportion of someone’s thoughts and behaviors are systematic (predictable) and what proportion are in the statistical error term?\nThis would be consistent with, but more general than, the classical conception. Immiseration of the “workers” as in the Marxian eschatology would become only a special case of such falling through the cracks. Capitalism grinds the workers to the bottom of its barrel and the revolutionary mechanism in the Marxian view is essentially that, eventually, the workers are pushed through the barrel itself, they see the system from its outside (class consciousness), and therefore are finally free to smash the barrel. But metaphors for the “system” are just metaphors, and however we wish to model the system, there’s no reason why there shouldn’t be many conceivable pathways where individuals could find themselves (intentionally or randomly) having dodged the social conditioning which normalizes individuals into identification with the system. This would explain why and how intellectuals are disproportionately inclined to revolutionary conversion: they fall through the cracks by a totally different path, via the leisure of education, study, and creative intellectual work. But the essential logic which makes workers radical in the Marxian view could thus be unified with the same logic that makes intellectuals revolutionary. And then it would be a matter of identifying through theoretical and empirical research the necessary and sufficient conditions for individuals to escape the grid which so thoroughly shapes most individuals.\nCapitalist subjectivation requires a layered process of ideological conditioning; the typical lifespan of a human being in the modern world is a complete archeology of layered ideological conditioning processes that would be dangerously obvious if they were not so effective: the family, where life itself begins as emotional and physical indentured servitude and continues as a process of paying back the father and mother until death; the school, where the cost of food for the social intellect is not just cultivating a taste for obedience to arbitrary authority, but contributing to its legitimacy insofar as the students’ presence constitutes that legitimacy; the workplace, where the price paid for survival outside of the family is just more uncritical submission to whatever institution which takes its place; and finally the re-production of the family itself, which is not actually a successful egress from this inherited chain of uninterrupted submissions that constitute everyday life (however much modern weddings pretend it is), it is actually just passing the buck to the next generation. Having children is merely a debt-swap in which the creditor (society) allows the indentured servant (the young adult) to escape its unpaid and unpayable debt on the condition that it produce a new person who will pay it with interest (the child). The stress, self-sacrifice, and perpetual ethical castration of raising a child today is akin to an exorbitant transaction fee for this debt-swap.2 Yea, OK, we’ll let you pass the debt on to a new person but don’t think you get freedom instantly: if you don’t pay the transaction fee that saps whatever desire might remain in you, then you will be unbearably stigmatized and ostracized as a “bad parent.” Notice that, for better or worse, the most famoulsy radical and effective intellectuals have historically been awful parents, effectively defaulting on this debt altogether.\nTo measure this concept of proletariat, we would highlight Marx’s main variable of material degradation but also intellectual and spiritual degradation, without necessarily privileging one or the other. Thus, a general formula would understand all individuals as characterized by three variable terms work, ideology, capital and different values under which an individual breaks from identification with the system. Thus a worker’s interest in the system is increasing in ideology and income but decreasing in work:\nu = ideology + income - work,\nThe traditional Marxian theory of the individual-level revolutionary mechanism is that workers are invested in the system by ideology but the hold of ideology breaks as their labor is increasingly alienating while their income is decreasing. According to Marx, a worker becomes revolutionary when work increases and income decreases enough to outweigh the investments from ideology.\nBut Marx and so many of his followers never really took seriously the revolutionary positions of bourgeois intellectuals. What this reconceptualization suggests, though, is that the revolutionary defection of bourgeois intellectuals is according to the same essential conception of human beings as the theory of worker defection, only from different movements of the same variables. The defecting bourgeois intellectual receives relatively high income for relatively little work but dis-identifies with the system through decreasing ideological investment. This is simply because true education is the depletion of ideology. This also explains why as anyone’s true education increases, status quo institutions either increase their income, decrease their work, and/or dilute their ability to think and speak freely.\nOf course, in reality, a multitude of other, additional institutional investments enter into the equation, such as family investments or racial, gendered, or nationalist investments. All of these institutional investments provide individuals with perceived utility from the system and therefore increase their attachment to the system, and decrease the probability of a revolutionary break. And theoretical and empirical research would have to pursue as an open question the degree to which these different investments account for the inertia of the status quo, and the conditions under which they decrease or increase their hold on individuals.\nAs for strategy, two thoughts suggest themselves. The first is to search for and find all those who for any reason have fallen through the cracks and to organize around the simple criterion of minimal investment in the status quo.3 The second is that statistical probabilities are essentially scientific maps for how not to think and behave. Statistics allow us to map with extreme precision the paths of resistance. This is because statistical distributions of thought and behavior across the status quo are exact measurements of what the system desires. Thus, I would make the case that the inversion of empirical statistical likelihoods is revolutionary political ethics. Randomness, along the lines of vulgar faux-Situationism or faux-Dada is not sufficient, for capitalism has an extraordinarily high tolerance for randomness. What is necessary is to produce systematically unlikely social outcomes. Notions of “affirmative action” and even more radical variants on that theme are correct to move in this direction, but they typically fail to take seriously that producing unlikely outcomes is far more difficult a challenge than switching some seats at status quo tables. It requires that we have a far more sophisticated theoretical and empirically defensible model of how macro-structures actually respond to low-level individual or group behavior, and it requires that we orchestrate our individual and group behavior according to what are likely far more complicated and sophisticated strategic requirements.\n This Marxian schema of the proletariat still looms behind radical identity politics today in that a special revolutionary agency is now simply associated with various different groups other than the Marxian worker. Even where the concept of intersectionality is highlighted, implicitly or explicitly there is very often the notion that certain intersections of identity uniquely prime certain groups to certain aspects of revolutionary struggle. ^ For instance, it\u0026rsquo;s EITHER feed one’s children disgustingly shitty food in solidarity with the masses or naturalize them into hideously bourgeois food privilege, or intellectualized self-loathing privilege, OR\u0026hellip; ^ As a side note, it’s interesting how the internet at once enables this organization and has so quickly supplied its own institutional brakes, as radicals find themselves on the internet but they’re only allowed to find themselves so long as their theoretical and communicative frameworks are adequately consistent with the status quo.

Then in RStudio set the working directory to wherever the GSS.csv file is located on your computer.\nYou can then work through this script to get started on your own research project.\nIf you are absolutely new to using R and RStudio, I have also made a corresponding video walkthrough on Youtube, \u0026ldquo;Intro to R Studio and Basic Descriptive Statistics.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you are looking for a text, my favorite book for learning basic statistics in R is Andy Field\u0026rsquo;s Discovering Statistics Using R.\n{% highlight R %}\n##################################################\nRead data from your working directory You need to set that from the file menu. ##################################################\nread GSS.csv as a table (with values separated by a comma and with the first row reserved as names). gss\u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026ldquo;GSS.csv\u0026rdquo;, sep=\u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo;, header=TRUE)\n##################################################\nsummary statistics ##################################################\nInstall package \u0026ldquo;pastecs,\u0026rdquo; which has a nice little summary.statistics() function install.packages(\u0026ldquo;pastecs\u0026rdquo;)\nLoad it into working memory library(pastecs)\nGenerate summary stats for importance attributed to work, relaxation, and politics stat.desc(gss$impwork, basic=FALSE)\nstat.desc(gss$imprelax, basic=FALSE) stat.desc(gss$imppol, basic=FALSE)\n##################################################\nGenerate some boxplots to compare the distributions ##################################################\npar(mfrow=c(1,3)) # Set up a graph with 1 row and 3 columns. # We do this because we plan to compare # 3 distributions. # R will just place the next three graphs # in these slots.\nboxplot(gss$impwork, col=\u0026ldquo;magenta\u0026rdquo;) # Make boxplot for the variable # \u0026ldquo;impwork\u0026rdquo; in the dataframe \u0026ldquo;gss\u0026rdquo; # and color it magenta.\nboxplot(gss$imprelax, col=\u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo;) # Make boxplot for the variable \u0026ldquo;imprelax\u0026rdquo; in the # dataframe \u0026ldquo;gss\u0026rdquo; and color it green.\nboxplot(gss$imppol, col=\u0026ldquo;cyan\u0026rdquo;) # Make boxplot for the variable \u0026ldquo;imppol\u0026rdquo; in the # dataframe \u0026ldquo;gss\u0026rdquo; and make it magenta.\n##################################################\nBox plots are good but not great. violin plots are similar but better because they represent the distribution directly. ##################################################\ninstall.packages(\u0026ldquo;wvioplot\u0026rdquo;) # install the package called \u0026ldquo;wvioplot\u0026rdquo; for making # violin plots library(wvioplot) # load the library of the package \u0026ldquo;wvioplot\u0026rdquo;\npar(mfrow=c(1,3)) # Set up a graph with 1 row and 3 # columns.

It will automatically import the Eurobarometer Trend File (1970-2002), a large survey dataset asking individuals across European countries a wide variety of questions in many different years. This document is intended to rapidly “bootstrap” individuals with zero programming knowledge into being able to conduct fairly sophisticated anlayses on a wide variety of political questions. In particular, this is intended especially for undergraduate political science students with no background in computer programming, interested in questions about political attitudes/behaviors, who wish to challenge themselves and build their skills/experience with quantitative data analysis. You can use this as a springboard to learning how to use R independently, but this document is not intended to teach you that. It’s a purely practical guide to jumpstart your capacity to produce analyses; everything else is up to you.\nIf you find this fun/interesting/useful/exciting, then you might want to actually learn the language a bit more. For excellent, easy, free interactive tutorials try: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r and/or http://tryr.codeschool.com/\n Setup Download and install R (it’s free.) Download and install RStudio (it’s free). Find and download the Eurobarometer codebook for your reference Open RStudio  R is the programming language and RStudio is the application we will actually open, see, and do our work in.\nLoad this starter script I have written for you.  After opening RStudio, go to File \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R script and copy-paste that starter script into the new script file. Or download that that starter script as a .R file and then go to File \u0026gt; Open File and select that .R file. You can just select all of the text in that script and click “Run” (or command-Enter on a Mac), to rapidly have your computer do some basic data wrangling tasks and estimate, as well as visualize, the relationship between media exposure and the probability that individuals in the UK would vote in the 1994 European Parliament elections. To do your own original analysis of something totally different, you can peruse the codebook of the Eurobarometer data and copy/tinker with the code in my script to apply it to your own variables of interest. You can also choose different countries in different years, but in your first analyses, focus on one country in one year because things get statistically complicated when you have multiple countries and multiple years.\n Run the script and voilà ### Starter script for analyzing the Eurobarometer Trend data (1970-2002). ### Outline: ### 1.

There is this kind of tradition in left-wing circles, to discuss, around the holiday season, how to \u0026ldquo;deal\u0026rdquo; with those family members who think or say things out of line with educated progressive morality.\nThis is a great example of how left-wing individuals elevate their own anxiety and insecurity into an ethical value. This recurring conversation about bigoted family members is really dumb, for a few reasons. Obviously if a family member is violently abusive, that’s a different story. My comments here are about the typical, mostly harmless Archie Bunker type with outdated and offensive viewpoints.\nFirst of all, other people are not problems for you to solve; that\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of psychopathic. It’s pathological not only to see human beings as an obstacle-thing you need to strategize about, but it’s especially pathological to imagine you have some kind of knowledge or power to do something with or to these people you define as problem-objects, outside of their participation. When we are really honest, it is always obvious that other people are generally complete mysteries; this is true and remains true for even the people we know most deeply, so it is certainly true of most people in one’s extended family who, let’s be honest, you hardly know.\nSo what is really going on in this left-wing leitmotif about the trials and tribulations of dealing with “problematic” family members during the holidays?\nThe reality is that many left-wing people simply find it awkward and difficult to sincerely and meaningfully interact with people who perhaps have drastically different values and experiences and vocabularies. It is a difficult fact of reality that there exist fundamentally different ways of dealing with our existential situation as human beings, and some of those ways we will find horrifying. It\u0026rsquo;s fine to disagree profoundly with the attitudes or practices of family members, it\u0026rsquo;s even fine to be horrified by them. But it is a core dilemma of human existence that there will be people to whom we are inextricably bound, people with whom we share irreplaceable bio/physio/chemical/emotional mutual investments, people who literally made us and continue to make us (whether we admit it or not), who think and speak in ways we may believe to be deeply wrong. Life is filled with irresolvable tensions, and if radical politics means anything it means learning how to live despite those tensions, but even more radically than inherited status quo norms permit.\nThe only reason we can so strongly disagree with the thoughts and behaviors of our own family members is because our complex society is such that we all have been cast down fundamentally different lanes of experience. Most importantly, socialization through the education system (note I do not say “education” itself), entry into urban and cosmopolitan cultural markets as a pathway to economic survival and personal advancement, etc. Educated progressive people like to imagine that what separates them from their Archie Bunker uncle is enlightenment, understanding, and ethical sensitivity. But that\u0026rsquo;s just not really true; it\u0026rsquo;s mostly the arbitrary fact of fundamentally different socialization experiences, milieus, and—what leftists never like to talk about regarding themselves—incentives. All I mean by this is that there are economic and social rewards to be gained through dexterity with “progressive” moral respectability, at least if you are an educated young adult pursuing a path for yourself in the new social economy. If you care passionately about knowing, for instance, various types of gender pronouns and your Archie Bunker uncle doesn’t, that’s in part because you have potential access to economic and social rewards for that effort (writing for cool magazines, building networks in cities, or even just feeling morally superior to others, etc.). You’re probably not a better person than your Archie Bunker uncle, you might just care more about promoting yourself in a world that he doesn’t care about impressing.\nThe only really progressive or radical question here is: how does our society separate and confuse us so drastically by subjecting us to different experiences, and how can human beings identify these mechanisms in order to find fundamentally new places and paths to collective liberation?\nI think the way to answer this question is to begin with the more preliminary question — at least once a year! – “How have I come to be so different from the people who made me?” In this difference, is there not some higher insight to be gleaned about how social evils become not only possible but constantly reproduced over long periods by structures so much larger than you and your vaguely racist Auntie?”\nIn turn, to really approach this question with any kind of honesty, one has to at least be open to the possibility that the ways in which our society has made us different from our family members has involved errors and injustices on our end. The perennial righteousness performance observed in left-wing circles around the holidays could not be a more perfect script for someone actively dedicated to refusing any consideration of this possibility. And that\u0026rsquo;s when you begin to realize that this perennial performance has probably been evolved for exactly this purpose, for the simple reason that this process is challenging and confusing and disorienting and requires a self-distancing and detachment for which we have almost completely lost the capacity; and now, in our rapidly paced hyper-technological society, it is so much easier to protect and advance our current partial, alienated but armored selves through cheap social broadcasting.\nOne reason we can’t put our own narcissism on hold for even one long day with family is that we are the ones who have stopped placing our bets on family, instead investing most of our daily emotional resources into these electronic dopamine circuits that have become the main source of energy and inspiration for some people. The problem is that, while this electronic dopamine intravenous may work well to make our vegetative lives endurable, so many people are choosing this membership in the electronic-cosmpolitan righteousness circuit at the cost of, and in betrayal of the deep, tense human relationships (i.e., kin, tribe, etc.) that have always been the bedrock energy supply of real revolutionary social transformations.\nBut guess what? Our species has evolved a really clever solution to this problem we all have – of getting so lost in our own heads, of becoming so infatuated with our own partial commitments and investments. It\u0026rsquo;s called the holiday.\nThe whole point of holidays is to pause absolutely everything about the real, serious, workaday world. It is an unconditional timeout, a limited and specific period in which everyone agrees to stop keeping score. Already I can hear some of my friends saying, “But Uncle Johnny who uses homophobic language is the one violating this timeout, it’s his fault!” But Uncle Johnny is not \u0026ldquo;starting\u0026rdquo; the conflict here, you are starting it in your brain with you presumptions that you have and that he doesn’t have, that you\u0026rsquo;re applying to him before you even ask him what he means or what he thinks. An important fact people will rarely knowledge is that you can very well start a conflict as the listener. Aggression or \u0026ldquo;violence,” as leftist types like to say, can be initiated by a listener. This is the dirty little secret of left-wing types who type-cast family members as problems before the holiday even begins.\nTrue militancy requires a capacity for the most calm sensitivity; true militancy means being militant also about one\u0026rsquo;s own limits and fixations and biases; true militancy has to be militantly honest about the fact that there are existential tensions in the world and that the deep necessity of love and familial bonds are sometimes in tension with that which we hold most dear in our personal worldviews. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing militant or radical or progressive about acting like you already have all of these things sorted and it’s all just good material for inside jokes on Facebook.\nThe truth is that we need our families because we don\u0026rsquo;t have ourselves sorted and we probably never will, because those people made us and we need them to continue making us, just as they need us to continue making them. This is a major blow to our ego’s wish for independence, but it\u0026rsquo;s an almost physiological, material fact. The holidays, if you go into them honestly and openly, can be a dynamic, interesting, challenging, and also comforting and recalibrating and inspiring experiment where people who are remarkably the same and yet so different can learn otherwise impossible-to-glean insights about the nature of society. In the process, all parties can become fundamentally different people slightly more aligned with the real truth that surely exists more fully among them than inside any one of them. This does not require anyone to have a particular education or socialization – if you think it does, then again, you should really consider whether you are not the one bringing the “violence” of everyday life into your family gatherings.\nI write this today in a country other than the one that holds most of my family. My partner and I will spend this holiday as a family of two, but I will miss my family in the United States tremendously, especially the most conservative ones, those whose beliefs have in the past genuinely scared and saddened me. I genuinely would most love to see them and have fun with them, not because I will miss the opportunity to \u0026ldquo;educate\u0026rdquo; them, but because I will miss the opportunity to be educated by them about my own anxieties, about my own inability to control others, and about the fact that fundamentally different people exist who can nonetheless have fun together. Nothing in this attitude supports bigotry or \u0026ldquo;allows it to persist;” this is something left-wing types say to convert their social anxiety and fear of tension into an act of heroic virtue. But there\u0026rsquo;s nothing heroic or virtuous about being so wrapped up in one\u0026rsquo;s head so as to be incapable of going on holiday with the people who made you.\nIf there is any heroic, progressive achievement available during the holidays, it is figuring out how to sincerely have fun with people you may sincerely consider bigots. In such a situation, sincere fun may teach you that what you thought was bigotry is not actually bigotry, or if there is real bigotry then there is a chance that together you will access something that undermines the real, core drivers of bigotry. In any event, the mutual disarming effect of sincerely uncritical being-together is almost guaranteed to provide novel reflections and insights on at least someone’s side. Tense and anxious guardedness due to vague, unspoken mutual suspiciouness may very well be the single least progressive atmosphere for a family holiday, and yet it is one of the most common. I would go so far as to say that if there is any attitude or behavior that perpetuates bigotry during family holidays it is the overly educated, anxious incapacity of the upwardly mobile to have fun with family members whose only real ethical failure is that they simply do not care what people on the internet think. This year I will miss my reactionary family members the most because I love them, and love is the most concretely exhilarating and transformative when it operates against everything else that one tends to think and feel on a daily basis.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574887896,"objectID":"ba8ae3fdb6acd33682177c71a1b88463","permalink":"/post/2016-12-20-family-holidays/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-12-20-family-holidays/","section":"post","summary":"Your grandmother is not a bigot if her only ethical failure is that she does not care what people on the internet think about her.","tags":["family"],"title":"How to deal with family during the holidays?

But underneath this public performance of shocked horror coming from the typical cosmopolitan progressive today, hides a curiously under-discussed paradox. If the forces of ignorant hate suddenly appear to be winning, then shouldn’t the sophisticated and morally enlightened be clever enough to understand what is happening and do something to stop these trends? If we are so smart and moral and our understanding of the world so much more reasonable and broad and sophisticated, then why are we so puzzled and terrified at the election of Donald Trump or the vote for Brexit? Shouldn’t we be able to understand it and act with our greater moral and empirical sophistication to resist and reverse these developments? If close-minded and hateful ideas and actors are gaining political ground, then why are we not clever enough to understand what is happening and act in order to change it?\nI believe the most likely answer is that educated progressives are significantly less clever than we pretend to be; indeed, if one is really shocked and horrified at the election of Trump or Brexit, the truly clever and ethical thing to do would be to think really hard and honestly about whether one has possibly been deeply mistaken about something, somewhere along the line. Of course, almost nobody does this, largely because those whose job it is to think and speak in public get paid (in money or else cultural capital) to assume the position of knowing more than someone else. There is no market for people who want to reflect at length about the ways in which they have been dumb, so all we ever hear or read is educated progressives pretending to be smart, no matter how badly they seem to be losing their battles and misestimating events. Shock and horror are natural enough responses, but that’s the problem: shock and horror are the easiest and most immediately reasonable responses to any turn of events that reveals something about one’s basic worldview to be mistaken when that basic worldview nonetheless remins tightly held.\nI think the real reason educated progressives are so confused and terrified is that the politics of educated progressivism is itself one of the key drivers of right-wing populism and, potentially, fascism. I will try to explain why but, at the outset, it is crucial to see how this very possibility is almost by definition unthinkable in the worldview of the educated progressive, whose most charasteristic mental and political operation is to use their educational resources to navigate themselves into those positions that are the most correct, the most true, the most good. Whether they are conforming themselves to the correct and the good, or conforming the correct and good to themselves, is typically undecidable to an external observer; whichever the case may be, the crucial point is that the educated individual is able to do this more effectively than the uneducated individual, and it helps them get ahead of the uneducated, both economically and socio-psychologically; but if, in the final analysis, the educated have made certain systematic mistakes, it becomes an especially dangerous problem for the long-run dynamics of a political system. Such a problem is especially dangerous because the educated are appointed by institutions to be the chief intellectual error-correctors; if the intellectual error-correctors are systematically erring, then the only mechanism for the political system to correct itself will be through the brute force of those individuals and groups who have no resources or opportunities to sublimate their political interests into respectable language games.\nIt is the educated who, without knowing it, blinded by their overly effective skills in manipulating symbols, have increasingly made the world in their own image but otherwise uninhabitable for those without access to the knowledge economy and cosmopolitan sociability.\nThe political style of educated progressives is: convert your personal interests into a moral language that you believe is good for everyone, then do everything you can to make that moral language dominant, even against anyone who disagrees or does not understand you. A key point is that this style is brute force, it is simply brute force sublimated to the “higher” level of language, symbols, and morals. It is brute force because, often quite explicitly, educated progressives do not care if some people disagree or do not understand; typically, educated progressives proudly proclaim that the opinions or ignorance of bigots (defined as those who do not know, understand, or agree with the preferred vocabular of educated progressives) should be overridden by collective political power. The magic of this style is that educated progressives sincerely believe they are not operating with brute force but are simply effectuating the triumph of reason and morality.\nThe educated progressive gambit works for a while, and educated progressives get to feel like they are living at the frontiers of moral historical progress, but the very rope that educated progressives use to pull themselves above ignorant bigots is the very same rope with which they suddenly find themselves being hung. And that’s because you cannot effectuate real historical progress of any kind whatsoever by using unequally distributed resources (education) to promote your own interests (international jobs, working in the culture industries, etc.) while proudly dismissing the thoughts and feelings of those you find repulsive in large part because they do not have the resources to dissemble their own self-interest into respectable language as you do. If this is your method of advancing social justice, you’re actively begging right-wing demagogues to rise up, because your entire method involves using your educational privileges to push those you call bigots even further and further away from being able to promote their interests through non-violent channels. This in no way justifies or apologizes for fascists, it only seeks to give an honest and non-self-serving account of the real causes behind such awful political formations.\nMany educated progressives, openly or secretly, really do not want uneducated right-wing people to have a public voice equal to their own. Their intellectual style demonstrates this quite undeniably. But educated progressives have made the mistake to believe this can work indefinitely. Perhaps educated progressives have begun to really believe that uneducated conservatives with so many unsavory notions are sub-human. Well, it turns out no group of human beings will tolerate for very long having their thoughts and feelings and interests defined in advance as outside the bounds of acceptable discourse. Any group of human beings treated this way will eventually prefer to adopt an ethos of violence against any and all untrusted out-groups, rather than try to play a peaceful language game the rules of which are quite literally determined (and frequently, aribitrarily changed) by those with opposite interests.\nWe have underestimated the violence of the educated progressive political style; it has been at once an ethical and strategic mistake, and now educated progressives are losing because of it. For educated cosmoplitan types, it feels natural that we are all part of one world. But people do not automatically have access to the world, or even a world. Worlds are constructed. It is the implicit claim of liberal cosmopolitanism that we are in one world. Ergo, if for any reason one cannot participate in the norms of liberal cosmopolitanism, such a sorry soul is for all intents and purposes not in the world. To the degree the liberal cosmopolitan view is shared across a society, someone who for any reason is not participating in that world can and should feel as if they are literally excluded from the world. So before we find ourselves shocked and horrified at some future triumph of violent right-wing politics, let’s also think harder than ever about the possibility that perhaps we are the ones who have become so skillful at the subtleties of political violence that we honestly can’t believe it.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560910239,"objectID":"5cb764e151cb88b4de2a88188b80c013","permalink":"/post/2016-11-10-if-educated-progressives-are-so-smart-why-is-right-wing-populism-succeeding/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-11-10-if-educated-progressives-are-so-smart-why-is-right-wing-populism-succeeding/","section":"post","summary":"On the fake sophistication of cosmopolitan respectability.","tags":["ideology","violence","education"],"title":"If educated progressives are so smart, why is right-wing populism winning?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["resources"],"content":" | \nThis document demonstrates how to perform several routine tasks in the analysis of state-level economic and political data for multiple countries over time, using the programming language R.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Today, I paid $20 to Skype for a personal phone number good for three months. Incoming calls are free (as far as I can tell) and $14 more got me credits for making calls, which are only 2.3 cents/minute. Say I speak for 5 minutes per day, which is more than I typically do, that means $14 gets me almost 5 months. I am breaking my cell phone contract ($110) rather than pay $50/month for the next nine months until my contract is over.

      Dear Reader,
I am writing to tell you that I love you and I am already scared of losing you. That does not mean I like you, but I do love you and I don’t want to lose you. I don’t know what love is or what exactly people mean by it, but that is almost certainly what I wish to say. More and more I grow convinced that I know less and less, which is disappointing not least because I’ve always expected the opposite, that I would learn more and more as I go.

      Below is the daily schedule I will try to follow every weekday while the university is in session. I’ve designed this in a way I think is realistic with respect to my strengths, weaknesses, and priorities, but also as ruthless as possible with respect to my worst demons.
5:55am - 6:00am. Wake up and get out of bed immediately. No snooze, no lying around. You’re typically slow to get up after waking because you sometimes dread the day ahead, but this is only because you’re lack of self-discipline makes your days harder and more confusing than they need to be.

Justin Murphy: I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science. I am in my fourth year as a graduate student. I study International Relations and my research focuses on how mass media conditions states&rsquo; responses to international politics. I&rsquo;m also a TA.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Walking through the city centre a few Saturdays ago, I made eye contact with a thin young blonde girl wearing a huge camouflage army coat and when I did the vague acknowledgment smile thing she murmured something to me which of course I didn’t really hear. I took out my earphones or earbuds or whatever they’re called now, and asked what she said. She was promoting a party thing at a nightclub and, in a strong northern accent, asked if I liked house music.

    <h2><a href="/post/2016-11-22-is-there-an-obligation-to-speak-out-if-nobody-is-listening/">Is there an obligation to speak out if nobody is listening?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Whenever horrific, unjust things occur, online social networks fill up with people telling you it is your duty to speak out against those things on the internet. But that is wrong: One’s duty is to determine as honestly and rigorously as possible the empirical conditions that would make those horrible things stop, and then to mold one’s life around increasing the probability of those conditions coming into existence. Clearly, it is hard to know for sure what exactly are those conditions and how exactly they are most likely to be brought about, so even in the most optimistic, mass revolutionary awakening we would hope to see many people doing many different things in many different ways.

    <h2><a href="/post/14482563142/">Living and writing of a present insurrection</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It is difficult to write of a present insurrection. Journalize, polemicize, moralize, historicize, predict? Considered individually, all traditional modes of reflecting on politics seem insufficient or inappropriate. Someone once said that humans make their own history but not any history they please, so rigorous attention must be paid to the empirically knowable horizons of material, intellectual, and technological possibility. But if we insist on a different future, a future that is truly a future, a future not reducible to current perceptions of the possible, then writing of the present must dare to speculate, hope, or even predict, if only as rhetorical actions that are sometimes capable of producing possibilities that really never even existed to justify such projections in the first place!

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Reflections on social science, honesty, insurrection, communism, carts, and horses.  I took a bus from Southampton to attend the Radical Left General Assembly in London last Thursday night. I took the trip for two special reasons. The Tory victory completely flummoxed political scientists, so as a political scientist I was especially curious to see how London radicals would start filling this cognitive vacuum left open by the systematic errors of the official intelligentsia.

    <h2><a href="/post/3603183973/">Self-immiserative technomadism</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      My philosophy is shifting toward what I would like to term self-immiserative technomadism. The old Marxian hypothesis about the increasing immiseration of the working classes under capitalism has not fared well. The lowest classes apparently have more to lose than their chains, and thus one of the key revolutionary mechanisms theorized in the Marxist tradition is irrelevant in the advanced liberal democracies. I think an attractive solution is the self-immiseration of the disillusioned factions of the bourgeoisie.

      @jmrphy Have you joined the monarchist Catholic NRx, or just being ironic? So hard to tell these days&hellip;
&mdash; Geoffrey Miller (@primalpoly) March 21, 2017 
I wasn&rsquo;t being ironic about Mary Stuart, or the world-historical catastrophe of the Reformation. I might still be something of a hipster but I really don’t do irony very much at all. Although I do sometimes try on for size somewhat hyperbolic versions of claims that I do sincerely believe, and I use the experience of the more extreme articulation as feedback for deciding whether that more extreme version of the claim is good or bad.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Revolution is the radical demystification of desire beyond demand; conservatism is the mystification of desire by its reduction to demand.
Media spokespeople, critics on the right, and even sympathetic but timid bourgeois progressives everywhere will not cease clamoring, in so many obviously trembling equivalences: “Eventually, you’ll have to, sooner or later, focus, articulate demands, we understand your rage, but eventually, you’ll have to narrow the issues, what exactly do you want?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Voices in mainstream media debate whether the American occupation movement is or will become a _bona fide_ national political movement. Predictably, many sympathizers on the left do not hesitate to call it such, while critics, mostly on the right and mostly those who have the most to lose from a serious resurgence of militant democracy, dismiss our present insurrection as child’s play. Is it the 99% not yet fully organized, or less than one percent pretending to speak for the masses?

    <h2><a href="/post/2015-04-25-the-plague-of-respectable-adults/">The plague of respectable adults</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The youth are supposedly naive and idealistic because they believe in changing the world, until adulthood comes and teaches them the hard lessons of reality. But this is only an ideological fantasy which conveniently assuages the guilt of adults at the same time it deludes and flatters the youth. In fact, for several decades now the youth have been denied access to the naive idealism which is their birthright but for which they nonetheless continue to be mocked. All better to push the youth into an uncritical stupor which was once only imaginable in the most resigned of the elderly. To make the youth as stupid as adults: education today.

    <h2><a href="/post/2010-07-04-the-problem-with-drugs-as-counterculture/">The problem with drugs as counterculture</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Sure, Benjamin used hashish and mescaline; the hippies used pot, acid, and any number of other drugs. There are many examples of visionaries who used drugs. But today we have neither the erudition and discipline of a Benjamin, nor the capacity for love which the hippies still had. All we have is increasing atomism and incessant economic dislocations and disruptions. Contemporary recreational drugs, consequently, are misunderstood. Recreational drugs are still often seen as on the side of social change, a vague protest vote, from the critical and liberal-minded individuals opposed to outdated and provincial conservatives.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Why do so many respectable, intellectually oriented people (academics, artists, and activists) wish to exclude independent right-wing intellectual work on moral grounds? I have in mind several recent campaigns to ensure some right-wing writer/artist, not be allowed to speak or perform in some venue. I am going to make a general theoretical point about a widespread social phenomenon, but I should also be honest about the specific individuals and institutions I see as motivating case studies.

    <h2><a href="/post/2014-02-06-the-question-of-revolution-is-unavoidable/">The question of revolution is not romantic, it is unavoidable</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If I insist on the revolutionary position, it is not to insist on the dichotomy between revolution and reform. Most of us today will agree with Gorz that there exists a class of revolutionary reforms, at which point the relevant distinction becomes the distinction between revolutionary reforms and reformist reforms. Today, Nancy Fraser suggests the critical distinction is between &ldquo;system-conforming&rdquo; changes and &ldquo;system-transforming&rdquo; changes, but it seems to me that the long-standing theoretical and practical difficulty remains the same: which types of projects (individual or collective) effectively oppose capitalism and push society toward justice, and which types of projects (whether through mystification, co-optation, or defeat) merely improve capitalism for some at the price of renouncing the system-level opposition which would be the maximally true, coherent, and just position.

    <h2><a href="/post/the-radical-core-of-conservatism/">The radical core of conservatism</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Nobody wants to feel as if there is a &ldquo;big Other&rdquo; against which one has to defend oneself. Most people do generally want to learn about new ideas and the perspectives and experiences of others; I even think many people would be generally open to hearing marginalized voices and trying to understand how oppression works, but nobody wants to learn about new and strange ideas if they see those ideas as a pre-written doctrine which they&rsquo;re simply being told to accept.

    <h2><a href="/post/the-vertigo-of-social-mobility/">The vertigo of social mobility</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Institutions lure you by flattering you, in a world where it is nearly impossible to find recognition outside of them; you begin to see yourself only in institutions that pre-exist you and over which you exercise no influence. If this is perfectly internalized, then you get typical neuroses, mid-life crises, etc. Alternatively, if it&rsquo;s not perfectly internalized, then you get perpetual, mini crises up front; you perpetually realize you&rsquo;re over-worked and over-working on things that are somehow sterilized in advance so as to make sure you cannot exercise freedom over them and you also realize that no matter how hard you work you will not overcome this impotence.

    <h2><a href="/post/2013-09-15-there-are-more-than-enough-hours-in-the-day/">There are more than enough hours in the day</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The popular refrain that &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day&rdquo; is an interesting departure from the long and storied political and rhetorical battle to objectively decrease the hours of the working day. It is an extraordinary gauge of our political pacification that when so many people have such a hard time meeting a pervasive social and economic expectation, we would sooner ask for an extension of the expectation than its abolition.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      While many people on the left still pretend that &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; and &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo; are fake right-wing concepts, a number of us are beginning to realize the profound mistake of dismissive moral posturing. Get your popcorn ready now, because it&rsquo;s going to be a fascinating mess as more and more people on the left begin to realize that the cultural politics of policing moral symbols has been fully exhausted and defeated.

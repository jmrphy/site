    <h2><a href="/post/a-mass-media-theory-of-the-surveillance-state/">A mass media theory of the surveillance state</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Sarah Jaffe asks for a political economy of the surveillance state. I felt especially behooved to send her something not just because I&rsquo;m a young academic roughly in political economy but also because, as one of thousands of young adults in the U.S. who were radicalized in through Occupy Wall Street—I strongly identify with independent intellectuals like Sarah and the class war of which she writes. I believe, contrary to many activists and radicals, that the tools of academic political economy can be extremely powerful in the struggle for truth and justice in the social war.

    <h2><a href="/post/a-note-on-masculinity-and-self-expression/">A note on masculinity and self-expression</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      One characteristically masculine technique of expression is to translate feelings of fear and insecurity into verbal and gestural forms of aggression and bids for power. In other words: not expression at all, but rather the opaque, instrumental action of concretely attempting to remove an irritation by subduing its real or imagined sources. Not depleting or reducing fear and insecurity but simply displacing them onto others. What the average man expects from women, and indeed requires from them, in order to exist with the fears and insecurities he knows no other way to deal with, is the woman&rsquo;s passive compliance with this masculinist formula of translating felt fears and insecurities into aggression, and many popular tropes about male-female romance only catalog the most traditional and well-known ways in which women have figured out how to cope with these strategic ruses of masculine dissimulation which are intended to pass for expression.

    <h2><a href="/post/14483036324/">A return of the repressed? Preliminary theory and evidence on France, 1968 and Occupy Wall Street</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Only about 40 years ago the advanced, developed, democratic republic of France was very nearly overthrown by an egalitarian, non-Soviet, non-authoritarian, spontaneous, and mass-democratic political revolution. The most remarkable aspect of the events surrounding May of 1968 in France is how unfathomably distant its subjective experience seems from our own political consciousness today in a country such as the United States, considering how still extremely recent was 1968. Returning to these events, it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that between then and now there must have transpired some sort of deeply nefarious historiographical scandal.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The Puzzle There is a widespread consensus in the economics literature that the rise of information technology over the past several decades has been a “skill-biased technological change.” A skill-biased technological change increases the productivity of skilled workers more than it improves the productivity of unskilled workers, therefore increasing the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. This increased demand for skilled workers, ceteris paribus, increases their income relative to unskilled workers.

    <h2><a href="/post/a-thought-on-jealousy/">A thought on jealousy</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When one person is jealous of another, that jealousy can be oppressive for the other, of course, but it can also be perversely comforting: Jealousy is flattering. And in the most dangerous cases, rather than balance each other, the oppressiveness and the comfort fuel each other. If the oppression of jealousy is intolerable and even debilitating, the comfort that is supplied by its flattering component can begin to feel all the more needed.

    <h2><a href="/post/9537176228/">About the truth of pop music</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If I understand him correctly, musician and theorist John Maus argues that the way of listening called music can be brought forth universally through the core procedure of pop, which, to him, is the process of abstracting away from music all “concentrations” or particularities of its contingent production and enjoyment (namely, standardization, materialization, and multiplication).
According to Maus, the pop musicians R. Stevie Moore and Ariel Pink represent a tradition of pop music that approaches the singular truth of pop through an excessive enactment of its protocols.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      As knowledge has become so specialized, many people would rather ignore or criticize highly evolved specialist discourses rather than admit they simply cannot understand them. This allows specialists to emerge as genuine masters who come to dominate others through this particular dimension of objective superiority, whereas honest admissions of ignorance and uncertainty would be an empirically and normatively sophisticated basis for unifying the large mass of normal people into a living project transcending capitalism (i.

    <h2><a href="/post/2013-08-25-an-ironic-note-about-genius/">An ironic note about genius</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      To decide on an artistic or intellectual life is to believe that one is personally capable of contributing something new and valuable to human history. To believe oneself capable of such a feat is at once arrogant and quotidian, it is to see oneself as a genius but in a sense which all people rightfully ought to see themselves. Of course, every human being is just another thing evolved from millions of years of an idiotic (literally mindless) unfolding of the universe.

    <h2><a href="/post/analysis-of-gazaunderattack-tweets/">Analysis of #GazaUnderAttack tweets</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      During the Israeli-Palestinian attacks of last month, I scraped from the Twitter API about 270,000 tweets containing the hashtag #gazaunderattack. Given the unprecedented degree to which this war was fought online, tweets of this sort could and should become really important data for political scientists. I&rsquo;m too busy right now to say very much here, but I want to share some basic descriptive analyses for anyone who might be interested.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      **Table of Contents** {: #toc } * TOC {:toc}  Summary There is a lot of confusion about whether we’re seeing significant ideological change in the United States. With Trump and the re-appearance of white nationalism in the public spotlight, many people are wondering if conservative (right-wing) ideology is on the rise. One can find many influential outlets endorsing this notion. CBS, BBC, Vox, and certainly others have all run articles suggesting this.

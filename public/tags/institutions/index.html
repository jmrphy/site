    <h2><a href="/post/28361296582/">#10: An example of acceleration: books</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It will be objected that the web of language means words in fact have very high density, all of them having so many plugs in common. But the error here is to suppose that all words exist at all times in some ether. The density of words is potentially extraordinary, but only if they are mobilized. Thus, a tome of philosophy is capable of formidable density—for those who can, with the author, mobilize the whole web of words into and out of which the tome plugs, a book is capable of possessing a mass that literally exceeds that of the Earth.

    <h2><a href="/post/28368602901/">#11: The essential structure of institutions</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When the human thing enters the cave and enjoys shelter from the snow, it enters into an institutional relationship. An institution is any ensemble of which at least one of its constituent and constituting things is a human. Whenever the human enters into a relationship with a thing or multiple things, we say it is _institutional _because from the plain of immanence it does not simply exist but is also instituted insofar as the human is the space of the name, of designation.

    <h2><a href="/post/31236568524/">#12: Leisure time and the arts and sciences</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When it draws a picture of itself on the wall, as buffalo becoming human, it represents one of many distributions of investment possible for the caveman. He is reflecting in leisure time, an intensive good itself only produced by the physical labor of finding and walking into the cave. He simply continues to draw the map of his world, the next lines on the same map he drew across the earth in his footsteps to the cave.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/31301165393/">#13: Truth</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      By arriving at ideology and false consciousness, we thereby arrive at the question of truth, a question the history of philosophy has quite impressively muddled up with repressed nervous energy, as we will show.
If we understand Truth to be “that which really is the case” beyond contingent and arbitrary appearances, it becomes perfectly clear according to our model that in some sense, _there is only falsity. _That is, the generation and persistence of things, including maps or ensembles of word-things, cannot escape determination by arbitrary distributions of things across ensembles possessing no other positive sanction than a persistence into which, strictly speaking, they randomly stumbled at every stage.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/31367032446/">#14: Socratic honesty and Platonic betrayal</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The chief difficulty of logic stems from the ideological nature of language. Dealing only with truth, with internal consistency, logic models the essence of the thing but not its existence. Its existence can only be modeled by the whole map of it, which means not the image of an air-tight circle floating in space, but a map of the whole ensemble within which it is constituted and constituting and including the word-things of its negative space.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/31425089281/">#15: The institutionalization of philosophy as the repression of honesty</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It will be noticed that although we determine Truth and truth to be two false, ideological notions, we have opposed to these the third term of honesty. Honesty is human drive in full transparency, which manifests itself as the absolute and outright rejection of all currently existing things. In short, this is because all ensembles are only stabilized contingencies historically leveraged. The human drive, making no assumptions and having no reason to take anything for granted, quickly identifies the baselessness of all currently existing things.

    <h2><a href="/post/31591672062/">#16: Equilibrium and equality</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      “Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.” – Henry Miller
The political implications at this point in our exposition are an almost absurd combination of obvious and radical. The most important implication of the present framework is that it unites the aim of social science (demonstrable causal explanations of empirical phenomena) with the aim of political philosophy (demonstrable explanations of what is good or just). This is because everything indicates that the concept of equilibrium in scientific modeling has more than an etymological commonality with the concept of equality in political philosophy.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/31656480216/">#17: A call to friends</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      To take these introductory comments seriously is to unlock a whole new orientation for scientific research never before accessed by serious institutionalized scientific disciplines, especially the currently prevailing sciences of society. This present work is in no sense “interdisciplinary.” Rather, it is militantly anti-disciplinary, anti-_discipline _for that matter, and by scientific necessity. Moreover, what is at stake in this pursuit is a practical project of reconstituting that chain of speech, truth, and being—a chain of which Socrates is perhaps only the purest representative—which is the key to the history and fall of critical thought.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/24579221047/">#1: Energy, line segment, thing, circuit</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If we try to work from the most basic and uncontroversial terms, we might call by the name of energy (ἐνέργεια, “activity, operation”) that universal polymorphous lust that constitutes things. The universe is undeniably constituted and constituting, operating, and energy seems to be the best available term that accounts for it as a whole.
The term “energy” is not itself a thing or thing-in-itself (noumenon) because, according to classical physics, it is only indirectly observable, it exists only theoretically, abstractly deduced from observation.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/24772831771/">#2: Sinks and sources</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      But where does the energy within a thing come from? Of course, in the human study of proximate causes, energy always comes from some other thing, a battery, for instance. It is well known that the search for original causes quickly encounters philosophical and historical conundrums that have never been satisfactorily overcome. Thus, as far as we know, all things derive their energy from something else, some sort of source or proximate cause.

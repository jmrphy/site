    <h2><a href="/post/24781335024/">#3: Investment</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It suffices to point out for this first exposition of the model that reciprocity is an essential requirement of the relations among any and all sub-things which we will understand as composing an ensemble. However, the concept of reciprocity only represents the formal essence of another concept that has become at once a ubiquitious but diversely-employed and contested concept across the human sciences. What is here defined as reciprocity is the essential relationship that modern economics knows as investment.

    <h2><a href="/post/26168279973/">#4: Natural selection, random mutation, the material world</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The logic of _natural selection _given random mutuations of ensembles, explains the existence and extinction of ensembles over time. When we conceptualize the circuitry of thinghood according to electrical engineering, we court the error of thinking that energy is something manipulated by the menu of options known to the electrical engineer. Just as Darwin illustrated the theoretical gains to be had by dispensing with God as the designer of everything, we should, for the same reasons, theorize energy as subject to “random mutations.

    <h2><a href="/post/26169976260/">#5: Human, idea, immanence, intensive space, drive</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      “But an animal does not feign feigning.” – Jacques Lacan, Écrits_ The human is what emerges when an ensemble randomly generates an idea. An idea is a thing noteworthy only because the idea-thing is not already a thing; it is a lie, a thing supposed into existence precisely because it does not exist, a becoming. An existing ensemble falsely priding itself into a new existence by the false implication that there is some-thing outside of existing.

    <h2><a href="/post/26611510115/">#6: Maps (ideas as things)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Figure 4 represents the random mutation of what is most commonly thought of as the idea or thought, but which is simply a new thing: the map. The appearance of the “idea” as well as the character of material objectivity are different intensive things modeled on a map-thing. It is easy to see that a map, any map, implies infinity by virtue of the map’s finitude, by virtue of having produced horizons.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/26662745326/">#7: Not methodology but the realization of beginning</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      “It is a tremendous act of violence to begin anything. I am not able to begin. I simply skip what should be the beginning.” – Rainer Maria Rilke
It is only when the mapping animal emerges that distinguishable things emerge, hence a diagrammatic representation of the world of humans includes names. Importantly, names as intensive things occupy the negative space of what is now known as the material object. This is especially important for two reasons.

    <h2><a href="/post/26663269622/">#8: Mass, force, acceleration, power</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If we take at their word those who urge interdisciplinarity, there is no reason to stop before even the venerable theory of gravitation—just another partial angle of aristocratic claptrap on the true theory of things.
Newton’s second law suggests that gravitational force equals the product of a body’s mass and its acceleration (F=ma). This implies that any two bodies are attracted to each other by the same force (the gravitational constant), but that the smaller object will accelerate toward the large object much faster than the larger object, why the apple falls toward the Earth rather than vice-versa.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/28360475868/">#9: Volume, diameter, density, ideology</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The diagrams of Figures 3 and 4 each capture five things characterized by three sources (input arrows) and three sinks (an original and two tangential splits); one thing with four sources and four sinks; and one thing with two sources and two sinks. Here, _volume_ is equal to the _diameter_of the thing, and _density_ is equal to the number of plugs (sources/sinks). The mass of an ensemble is then equal to its volume multiplied by its density.

    <h2><a href="/post/2015-11-03-anti-disciplinary/">Not inter-disciplinary but anti-disciplinary</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It will be asked whether this odd little volume intends to be both a serious contribution to the sciences of society and a genuine effort to aid in contemporary political movements. While I do believe it is both, I am aware that it may function as neither for the simple reason that I have avoided at all cost the mystifying and inherently conservative impulse to be useful with respect to the institutional status quo it is precisely our goal to overthrow.

    <h2><a href="/post/14513383241/">On the bureaucratic superego and conventional constitution of siege by joint emancipated forces</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Over the past five hundred years, political repression has been slowly but steadily delegated to the individual. The bureaucratic superego is what I call the function by which the individual prohibits itself from doing things that in the past would have been the jurisdiction of the Law. The driving force for this transfer of functions has been the flexibility of movement desired and required by capital over the course of history.

    <h2><a href="/post/2015-05-04-the-insurrection-of-having-no-power/">On the hopeless but effective insurrection of having no power whatsoever</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Many people believe it is possible to win a good and just society by organizing a counter-power to change status quo institutions. But when was the last time you heard any convincing argument or up-to-date evidence that this is still the case? Almost everyone who still holds this belief does so as an assumption inherited from some previous era of struggle.1 Many people will frankly admit they hold this belief simply because it is necessary to have hope against all odds, but this is wrong: it is necessary to know what is really the case, and anyway, a truthful renunciation of hope is both more joyful and more politically effective than an empirically implausible hope. While many, many people have been trying for a very long time to organize counter-power on the assumption that it exists and only has to be organized, very few people will even consider the idea that total defeat is a possibility, let alone that it may have already happened.2

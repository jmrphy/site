    <h2><a href="/post/9537176228/">About the truth of pop music</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If I understand him correctly, musician and theorist John Maus argues that the way of listening called music can be brought forth universally through the core procedure of pop, which, to him, is the process of abstracting away from music all “concentrations” or particularities of its contingent production and enjoyment (namely, standardization, materialization, and multiplication).
According to Maus, the pop musicians R. Stevie Moore and Ariel Pink represent a tradition of pop music that approaches the singular truth of pop through an excessive enactment of its protocols.

    <h2><a href="/post/16825969225/">Art and bribery</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The history of art is a history of bribery. A young person who for many possible reasons was lucky enough to escape complete and total ideological subjugation in the first few years of life keeps in touch with their sense of desire, a desire for everything, a desire obscurely but undeniably not satisfied by the social organization of the life into which they have been thrown. Thus, they create, they permit themselves the curious project of ascertaining that part of everything to which they are not permitted access.

    <h2><a href="/post/4508141351/">Finding modern pictures in the National Gallery</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      To enter the galleries of modern painting from the main entrance of the National Gallery one has to walk through two separate and gargantuan gift stores and two equally impressive dining areas. But really, this is appropriate and historically honest curation. In short, the National Gallery makes visitors access modern painting in the same fashion as history itself has accessed it: through consumption, through the postmodern.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Delivered at The Ox, August 18, 2011.
If God wrote the Bible today, he would be assassinated by the CIA because God was the most radical artist ever, creating so much in six days and only resting for one, never obeying a single law but only making up laws as he went. Socrates was, remember, assassinated by the CIA.
If you think you are an artist but do not get assassinated by the CIA, then it is probably evidence your work will not be very significant in the scheme of world history.

    <h2><a href="/post/26723407980/">Mark Rothko and the Freedom to Starve (#1)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Major premodern painters found freedom by circumventing or subverting the wishes of their patrons. Because the classical premodern artist faced a more or less unified set of masters—that is, a fairly unified, coherent social dogma backed by political force and other-worldy hellfire—it was possible to appease them on the surface but outwit them in the final artistic achievement. Today, the situation is fundamentally different. After the death of God, our authority is now the market, a fickle multiplicity of authorities.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I am on the third floor of the museum of the Art Institute of Chicago; I am sitting in a room with two Rothko color fields—I almost wanted to write “_of two Rothko color fields”_—each hanging alone, diametrically, on interior walls, walls which permit guests to flow in and out of the adjacent rooms. I am sitting on the floor halfway between the two large canvases and over to one side.

    <h2><a href="/post/26725036642/">Mark Rothko and the Freedom to Starve (#3)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Rothko was a painter who effectively declared that if the cost of artistic freedom is having to satisfy so many people and circulate the work of art through what is so painfully, obviously, a truthless and exploitative economy that is at once vulgar and elitist, then the only defensible direction is to take without giving, to reduce, subtract, and destroy everything inessential; if the artist is to be hemmed in on all sides by a systematic and dispersed arrangment of masters, then to the devil with the dream of representation and, even more radically, to the devil with any transmissable positive content whatsoever, to the devil with the fantasia of possessing an object, to the devil with deliverance.

    <h2><a href="/post/26726059365/">Mark Rothko and the Freedom to Starve (#4)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      In the year before he would die by his own hand, Rothko painted a series of acrylics known by art historians as the “Black on Grays.” From my perspective, hitherto the critical reception of this series has been altogether confused. As the _Catalogue Raisonné _summarizes:
 …nearly every visual and thematic strategy that critics have affiliated with these pictures is a trope of disenchantment or distance. They are as follows: they resemble moonscapes, the white margins are an alienating bid derived from taping down the works on paper (by foregrounding this devise the compositions thematize the process of artistic production) or prompted by the borders that Rothko noticed around reproductions of his own work; comparable margins were being used by Malcolm Morley and others at the time so as to ironize the subject of representation; the inchoate brown smears, squiggles and drips in the lower half are a careful affront to the pristine shine of the white acrylic…To conclude: blocked or drastically mediated vision disables intimacy and the very rules for the spectator’s engagement that Rothko himself had set.

    <h2><a href="/post/26726950175/">Mark Rothko and the Freedom to Starve (#5)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If one has never drawn a line, one does not even exist. But if one has the honesty to present nothing more than the line itself, one not only exists but also honestly and transparently dramatizes that simple self-assertion is the only requirement of a true human life. One of the aims of Rothko’s ouvre, in my reading.
Furthermore, we can say to a certain extent that the paintings of Rothko provide a formal framework for the ethical manipulation of formal, visual distinctions as arguably the only truth available in the art of late capitalism.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Myth is a founding lie or fantasy that is necessary to structure the present in the absence of true knowledge of actual origins. Just as the present’s coherence requires an unreal structuration from the past, so too does it need an unreal structuration from the future. There are many options whereby societies collectively negotiate a conception of the future that serves to structure, stabilize, and give meaning to the present. The well-known Enlightment theme of perpetual progress is only one example.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      We fetishize words in such a way that when someone says something, we are prone to find them outrageously evil should they choose certain words. But the reality is that the actual quality of human drives probably differs much less across history and space than we wish to believe. This sense is inflated by the significance we attach to particular words, and distorted in severe biases in the social distribution of verbal facility.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      What is a social justice warrior? The term SJW, short for social justice warrior, is now a well-known piece of internet slang. It refers to a particular tendency within left-wing political activism today. People often ask me to define &ldquo;social justice warrior&rdquo;, or they ask: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just an epithet, like &lsquo;political correctness,&rsquo; used by conservatives to dismiss the claims of marginalized people?&rdquo; Or else it is sometimes suggested that such an ideologically loaded term is beneath a Serious Social Scientist.

      Revolution is the radical demystification of desire beyond demand; conservatism is the mystification of desire by its reduction to demand.
Media spokespeople, critics on the right, and even sympathetic but timid bourgeois progressives everywhere will not cease clamoring, in so many obviously trembling equivalences: “Eventually, you’ll have to, sooner or later, focus, articulate demands, we understand your rage, but eventually, you’ll have to narrow the issues, what exactly do you want?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The youth are supposedly naive and idealistic because they believe in changing the world, until adulthood comes and teaches them the hard lessons of reality. But this is only an ideological fantasy which conveniently assuages the guilt of adults at the same time it deludes and flatters the youth. In fact, for several decades now the youth have been denied access to the naive idealism which is their birthright but for which they nonetheless continue to be mocked. All better to push the youth into an uncritical stupor which was once only imaginable in the most resigned of the elderly. To make the youth as stupid as adults: education today.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Sure, Benjamin used hashish and mescaline; the hippies used pot, acid, and any number of other drugs. There are many examples of visionaries who used drugs. But today we have neither the erudition and discipline of a Benjamin, nor the capacity for love which the hippies still had. All we have is increasing atomism and incessant economic dislocations and disruptions. Contemporary recreational drugs, consequently, are misunderstood. Recreational drugs are still often seen as on the side of social change, a vague protest vote, from the critical and liberal-minded individuals opposed to outdated and provincial conservatives.

      Nobody wants to feel as if there is a &ldquo;big Other&rdquo; against which one has to defend oneself. Most people do generally want to learn about new ideas and the perspectives and experiences of others; I even think many people would be generally open to hearing marginalized voices and trying to understand how oppression works, but nobody wants to learn about new and strange ideas if they see those ideas as a pre-written doctrine which they&rsquo;re simply being told to accept.

    <h2><a href="/post/14486977984/">U.S. media and ideological filtering as a global &#34;public good&#34;</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      In the study of international relations, there is a conventional and well-demonstrated theory according to which 1.) global stability is to be understood as a “public good,” and 2.) that due to strategic problems obstructing collective cooperation, often a hegemon is required to effectively subsidize it (Krasner 1976; Kindleberger 1981). Put very simply, in the absence of a hegemon, the global system tends toward conflict in a &ldquo;race to the bottom.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I’ve been curious about the new massive camp of Jordan Peterson acolytes. In one of my many prodigal late-night lurking sessions through the depths of Reddit, I noticed they collected some data on themselves. So here we go.
If you’ve been following my recent writing, podcasts, and videos, you’ll know I’m especially interested in the relationships between education, political correctness, taboo topics, and ideology.
I’ve been hypothesizing that there is a substantial number of culturally conservative (against the cultural leftism of the West) but libertarian (let people do what they want, free speech, etc.

    <h2><a href="/post/2018-02-16-who-is-afraid-of-free-speech/">Who’s afraid of free speech in the United States?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The topic of free speech is highly salient at the moment, but if you look at the public opinion data, you find some patterns quite incongruous with many of the popular talking points circulating right now. It seems that perhaps in the pushback against political correctness, many have been too quick to make generalizations about how &ldquo;the far left&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;radical liberals&rdquo; think about free speech. The now popular view that &ldquo;the left&rdquo; has turned against free speech is not totally wrong, but it&rsquo;s complicated.

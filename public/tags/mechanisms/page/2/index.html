    <h2><a href="/post/2015-04-19-on-being-honestly-bad/">On being honestly bad</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I am trying to express myself in some mode of life as freely as I can, and as wholly as I can, using for my defense the only arms I want to allow myself, arms which are not so much arms as disarmaments, and are for that reason the only legitimate and effective arms available in our world already armed to its teeth: unchecked boisterousness, indiscriminate participation in all things, and naïve transparency. I hypothesize that anyone who holds fast to these rules cannot err. Wherever the dust settles after a whole, naïve, honest soul distributes itself unrestrained into society, it cannot do otherwise than improve that society (and that soul). Unlimited expression, from the launching point of unbiased immersion in all things of the world, abetted by an absolute rejection of all temptation to dissimulation, means nothing other than giving back to the world a true image of itself.

    <h2><a href="/post/2012-08-04-becoming-adult/">On the social contract of entrance into adulthood</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The popular ideological notion of “growing up,” as an account of the transition from youth to adulthood, is the reverse of the truth. We say that the young person is naïve and silly, and that the process of growing into adulthood entails setting aside the immature unboundedness of youth and generally “settling down” morally (into the sturdiness of lifelong conviction), politically (into the conservation of order), socially (into the duties of family life), and economically (into a stable and respectable occupation and work ethic).
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/reactionary-law-and-bourgeois-desire/">Reactionary law and bourgeois desire</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      An unfortunate tendency of exceptionally repressive laws and draconian sentences is that, in middle-class eyes, they tend to justify themselves: to bourgeois stiffs, it begins to seem as if anyone who would risk such harsh punishments _must be_ so crazy and dangerous that it feels appropriate and reassuring to be protected by such a vicious legal machine. Indeed, the self-justifying effect of a draconian legal system increases as punishments get more severe for less and less significant behaviors.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/resentment-and-vegetarianism/">Resentment and vegetarianism</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      People only eat meat because their repressed rage makes them bloodthirsty. All forms of bloodthirst are driven by resentment and revenge; this is the only conceivable reason why smart and good-natured people insist on eating meat. Everyone is so oppressed by social institutions but unable to kill any of the humans responsible for those institutions, that the half-hearted laments of unapologetic animal-eaters often reduce to: “I must reserve at least this one right to exercise my insatiable need to take life for myself.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/revolutionary-fun/">Revolutionary fun</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Revolutionary fun is the only justified form of fun. Revolutionary fun is the fun had by playing with the power of those who have more power than oneself. Playing with the power of those who have more power than oneself is fun because it is the assertion of will over and against an illegitimate status quo. It is the enjoyment of creating anti-power. It is revolutionary because in its bold idleness it is inexplicable, enchanting, irresistably attractive.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2013-01-05-sensitivity-a-scarce-resource/">Sensitivity is a scarce resource</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Most people are sensitive in their relations with loved ones but insensitive to the far greater suffering of others. This is disastrous for the loved ones as well as humanity in general. The real challenge for loved ones must be to treat each other with loving insensitivity, a mutual respect so deep that it is impossible to silently indulge the other’s flaws and weaknesses. This is not only a truer and more mutually empowering path for the loved ones, but perhaps even more importantly, it reserves one’s limited resources of sensitivity for maintaining the highest possible degree of awareness and protest toward the rest of the world’s deepest and most urgent varieties of human suffering.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2017-06-20-the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/">The affective politics of keeping it real</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It once made sense for professional intellectuals to bite their tongue in exchange for the influence they could gain by conforming to the dominant language. For a while, this was arguably rational and defensible—perhaps even a game-theoretic necessity for anyone sincerely interested in cultivating a genuinely public and political intellectual project. While it’s obvious the internet has changed the game, old stereotypes die hard and continue to constrain human potential well after their objective basis has disappeared.

    <h2><a href="/post/2017-04-24-the-formal-structure-of-paranoid-leftism/">The formal structure of paranoid leftism (why there is no such thing as a noble error)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      People who want to think, write, or act outside of what is perceived as normal within currently consituted left-wing circles are now commonly talked about as possible fascist sympathizers. Typically, if you drill down into what is being said exactly, they are not accused of being fascists, they are accused of not clearly enough differentiating themselves from fascism, to a degree that exceeds the currently established expectations of what anti-fascism is believed to look like.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2013-08-31-the-hatred-of-freedom/">The hatred of freedom</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The truth is that most people do not want other people to flourish. We all support a general idea of everyone being freer but we tend to feel threatened whenever anyone in particular meets with an increase of freedom. Not long after, we begin to hate them for it if we are not welcome or able to enjoy in the proceeds.
      
    </div>

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2015-04-06-the-long-arc/">The long arc of the universe</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The well-known problem with “universal” social theories is they tend to privilege particular social groups over others while pretending to comprehend and represent all groups equally. But to speak of the *actual universe*—just the whole set of everything that exists in all of its complexity—while that may be a universalism of sorts, it is a universalism by definition without erasure, a universalism which sacrifices no particularity but is rather the universalism of every particular difference.

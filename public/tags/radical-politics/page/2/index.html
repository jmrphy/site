    <h2><a href="/post/24781335024/">#3: Investment</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It suffices to point out for this first exposition of the model that reciprocity is an essential requirement of the relations among any and all sub-things which we will understand as composing an ensemble. However, the concept of reciprocity only represents the formal essence of another concept that has become at once a ubiquitious but diversely-employed and contested concept across the human sciences. What is here defined as reciprocity is the essential relationship that modern economics knows as investment.

    <h2><a href="/post/26168279973/">#4: Natural selection, random mutation, the material world</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The logic of _natural selection _given random mutuations of ensembles, explains the existence and extinction of ensembles over time. When we conceptualize the circuitry of thinghood according to electrical engineering, we court the error of thinking that energy is something manipulated by the menu of options known to the electrical engineer. Just as Darwin illustrated the theoretical gains to be had by dispensing with God as the designer of everything, we should, for the same reasons, theorize energy as subject to “random mutations.

    <h2><a href="/post/26169976260/">#5: Human, idea, immanence, intensive space, drive</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      “But an animal does not feign feigning.” – Jacques Lacan, Écrits_ The human is what emerges when an ensemble randomly generates an idea. An idea is a thing noteworthy only because the idea-thing is not already a thing; it is a lie, a thing supposed into existence precisely because it does not exist, a becoming. An existing ensemble falsely priding itself into a new existence by the false implication that there is some-thing outside of existing.

    <h2><a href="/post/26611510115/">#6: Maps (ideas as things)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Figure 4 represents the random mutation of what is most commonly thought of as the idea or thought, but which is simply a new thing: the map. The appearance of the “idea” as well as the character of material objectivity are different intensive things modeled on a map-thing. It is easy to see that a map, any map, implies infinity by virtue of the map’s finitude, by virtue of having produced horizons.

    <h2><a href="/post/26662745326/">#7: Not methodology but the realization of beginning</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      “It is a tremendous act of violence to begin anything. I am not able to begin. I simply skip what should be the beginning.” – Rainer Maria Rilke
It is only when the mapping animal emerges that distinguishable things emerge, hence a diagrammatic representation of the world of humans includes names. Importantly, names as intensive things occupy the negative space of what is now known as the material object. This is especially important for two reasons.

    <h2><a href="/post/26663269622/">#8: Mass, force, acceleration, power</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If we take at their word those who urge interdisciplinarity, there is no reason to stop before even the venerable theory of gravitation—just another partial angle of aristocratic claptrap on the true theory of things.
Newton’s second law suggests that gravitational force equals the product of a body’s mass and its acceleration (F=ma). This implies that any two bodies are attracted to each other by the same force (the gravitational constant), but that the smaller object will accelerate toward the large object much faster than the larger object, why the apple falls toward the Earth rather than vice-versa.

    <h2><a href="/post/28360475868/">#9: Volume, diameter, density, ideology</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The diagrams of Figures 3 and 4 each capture five things characterized by three sources (input arrows) and three sinks (an original and two tangential splits); one thing with four sources and four sinks; and one thing with two sources and two sinks. Here, _volume_ is equal to the _diameter_of the thing, and _density_ is equal to the number of plugs (sources/sinks). The mass of an ensemble is then equal to its volume multiplied by its density.

    <h2><a href="/post/2013-11-03-a-concept-of-political-validity-in-quantitative-social-science/">A concept of political validity in quantitative social science</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Let us call bourgeois data any research data the collection of which is funded by groups invested in the status quo. Bourgeois data, which is to say nearly all the quantitative data used by social scientists, suffer from a specific type of bias for which most methodologists show very little concern, despite the extraordinary analytical attention they devote to the question of bias in social-scientific inference more generally. Methodologists are likely unconcerned about the possibility of institutional biases in data collection because they have precisely the same institutional investments as the funders of data collection projects.

    <h2><a href="/post/a-note-on-masculinity-and-self-expression/">A note on masculinity and self-expression</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      One characteristically masculine technique of expression is to translate feelings of fear and insecurity into verbal and gestural forms of aggression and bids for power. In other words: not expression at all, but rather the opaque, instrumental action of concretely attempting to remove an irritation by subduing its real or imagined sources. Not depleting or reducing fear and insecurity but simply displacing them onto others. What the average man expects from women, and indeed requires from them, in order to exist with the fears and insecurities he knows no other way to deal with, is the woman&rsquo;s passive compliance with this masculinist formula of translating felt fears and insecurities into aggression, and many popular tropes about male-female romance only catalog the most traditional and well-known ways in which women have figured out how to cope with these strategic ruses of masculine dissimulation which are intended to pass for expression.

    <h2><a href="/post/14483036324/">A return of the repressed? Preliminary theory and evidence on France, 1968 and Occupy Wall Street</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Only about 40 years ago the advanced, developed, democratic republic of France was very nearly overthrown by an egalitarian, non-Soviet, non-authoritarian, spontaneous, and mass-democratic political revolution. The most remarkable aspect of the events surrounding May of 1968 in France is how unfathomably distant its subjective experience seems from our own political consciousness today in a country such as the United States, considering how still extremely recent was 1968. Returning to these events, it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that between then and now there must have transpired some sort of deeply nefarious historiographical scandal.

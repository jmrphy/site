&lt;p&gt;Balaji Srinivasan put out &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280261091302375424&#34;&gt;a call&lt;/a&gt; for “the best diversity report on tech journalists,” building on some initial data collected by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian&#34;&gt;OoTheNigerian&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s my stab at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial dataset focused on the diversity of attendees at industry conferences, but this approach has two major limitations. First, conferences are subject to a variety of selection biases, which might not have anything to do with tech-journalism culture per se. Second, there are only so many tech-journalism conferences, so this approach will likely leave us with an unnecessarily small sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I pursue a different strategy. I first collect lists of tech journalists on Twitter. Then I leverage data from the Census and the Social Security Administration to infer each journalist’s race and gender. The resulting dataset allows us to estimate racial and gender diversity in tech journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my approach certainly has its own limitations, analyzing the culture of tech journalism via Twitter-based samples seems uniquely attractive. First, it’s possible some tech journalists are not on Twitter, but since Twitter is both a hot technology and a watering-hole for journalists, this potential selection bias seems particularly unthreatening. Twitter is arguably the ideal place to draw a sample of tech journalists. A second limitation of my approach is that I may very well fail to identify some tech journalists who are on Twitter, but this is only an analytical problem if there is some reason to believe that white people or male people are more or less likely to surface in my search procedures. Assuming this is very unlikely, the worst that can be said of my sampling method is that it’s unlikely to capture every single tech journalist on Twitter. Nonetheless, it is likely to be quite close to a random sample of all the tech journalists on Twitter, which means it should plausibly generalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a robustness check, I conduct the analyses on two different samples collected using two different Twitter-based sampling methods. In a first cut, I collect a sample of tech journalists by searching Twitter bios. In a second cut, I collect a sample from public lists of “Tech Journalists” curated by third parties. The results are nearly identical, suggesting the analyses below very likely reflect the underlying state of tech journalism, at least on Twitter. If I’m right that most tech journalists are on Twitter, then the analyses should generally reflect tech journalism as such. If there is a non-trivial community of tech journalists not on Twitter someone should tell them about what’s new in the world of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;approach-1-tech-journalists-who-mention-a-major-tech-journalism-outlet-in-their-bio&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approach 1: Tech journalists who mention a major tech-journalism outlet in their bio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the R package &lt;em&gt;rtweet&lt;/em&gt; to search for anyone on Twitter who mentions one of the following tech-journalism oulets in their bio: TechCrunch, ReCode, The Information, or The Verge. The API allows for up to 1,000 results per search, but in every case the number of results was less than 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Load required packages 

require(rtweet)
require(tidyverse)
require(predictrace)
require(stringr)
require(gender)
require(DT)

# Search for accounts mentioning tech-journalism outlets 

tc &amp;lt;- search_users(&amp;quot;@TechCrunch&amp;quot;, n = 1000)
tc$outlet&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;TechCrunch&amp;quot;

rc &amp;lt;- search_users(&amp;quot;@ReCode&amp;quot;, n = 1000)
rc$outlet&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;ReCode&amp;quot;

ti &amp;lt;- search_users(&amp;quot;@TheInformation&amp;quot;, n = 1000)
ti$outlet&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;TheInformation&amp;quot;

tv &amp;lt;- search_users(&amp;quot;@Verge&amp;quot;, n = 1000)
tv$outlet&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;TheVerge&amp;quot;

# Bind search results into one dataframe
journos&amp;lt;-rbind(tc, rc, ti, tv)

# Restrict to English language accounts
journos &amp;lt;- journos %&amp;gt;%
  filter(lang==&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  select(screen_name, name, location, description, followers_count, friends_count,
         listed_count,  statuses_count, favourites_count,   account_created_at, verified,
         profile_expanded_url,  outlet) %&amp;gt;%
  drop_na(name)

# Standardize and export for manual inspection
journos &amp;lt;- apply(journos,2,as.character)
write.csv(journos, &amp;quot;journos.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of accounts identified in this fashion was 1879, but most of them were false positives (the API does not seem to recognize the @ symbol). So I manually went through the results and narrowed the dataset down to individuals who included the outlet’s main Twitter handle in their personal bio. Typically the profile says something like “currently at X” or “formerly at X.” I also standardized names and removed emojis in preparation for the next stage of analysis. This process left 256 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we leverage the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictrace/vignettes/Predict-race-of-surname.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;predictrace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package to infer race from surnames, based on the co-occurrence of surnames and self-reported races in the Census datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we leverage the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gender/vignettes/predicting-gender.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;gender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package to infer gender from first names, based on the co-occurrence of baby names and gender in the Social Security Administration datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Load manually cleaned spreadsheet

# To partially mitigate the problem of under-identifying black people,

# I think there&amp;#39;s a bug in the predictrace package which fails
# to infer Hispanic race even when it identifies a very high probability
# of being Hispanic. I&amp;#39;m correcting this manually by inferring
# Hispanic race for any probability greater than .5.

race.profiles.df$likely_race&amp;lt;-ifelse(race.profiles.df$probability_hispanic&amp;gt;.5,

# Remove redundant columns
df&amp;lt;-select(df, -c(firstnames, lastnames, X, X.1, `race.profiles.df$likely_race`))

                        white = &amp;quot;White&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the simple numerical breakdown: 108 are likely white, 19 are likely Asian, and 2 are likely black.&lt;/p&gt;

I take these at face value and combine all the listed Twitter accounts into a new sample of tech journalists. Then I re-run all of the analyses above on this new sample.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The affective politics of keeping it real</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/06/20/the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2017/06/20/the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It once made sense for professional intellectuals to bite their tongue in exchange for the influence they could gain by conforming to the dominant language. For a while, this was arguably rational and defensible—perhaps even a game-theoretic necessity for anyone sincerely interested in cultivating a genuinely public and political intellectual project. While it’s obvious the internet has changed the game, old stereotypes die hard and continue to constrain human potential well after their objective basis has disappeared. In particular, the contemporary stereotype of the public intellectual as a self-possessed professional who regularly appears in “the media” to speak on public affairs in the royal language, is a contingent product of the postwar rise of mass broadcasting (one-to-many) media. In much of the postwar period, the classic “mass media”—newspapers, radio, television—had extremely large, mass audiences and where characterized by high costs of entry. This technical and economic environment offered huge rewards for speaking the dominant language within the paramaters of respectable opinion. It was probably with cable television that a centrifugal tendency began the processes of fragmentation, polarization, and decentralization that would eventually bring us to where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no longer any mass audience to speak to through dominant channels, overwhelming majorities do not trust mass media, and even the cognitively fragmented semi-mass audiences that remain will only listen to what they already think. Not to mention the masses probably have less power today than anytime in the twentieth century, so why bother even trying to speak to the masses? As a young academic, if I play by the rules for the next 10 years so that I might be respected by influential academics or gain access to regularly speaking on BBC or something like that, I would have sacrificed all of my creative energy for quite nearly nothing. As far as I can tell, today, the idea of biding your time as a young and respectable intellectual, to one day earn a platform of political significance, appears finally and fully obsolete. In one sense, this is already obvious to the millions who long ago stopped following mainstream media and long ago lost all respect for academic credentials; but in another sense, an overwhelming number of human beings continue to think, speak, and behave as if we are still operating in this old world, as if there is some reason to not say everything one feels like saying, as if there is some social or political or economic reward that will come toward the end of a respectable career of professional self-restraint. It’s easy for autodidacts and natural outsiders to say, “Duh, we told you so,” but this in no way comprehends or solves the really striking and politically significant puzzle that an extraordinary degree of human power remains &lt;em&gt;voluntarily repressed&lt;/em&gt; for rewards and punishments that no longer exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the self-restrained professional intellectual is shaped by the rewards of a media environment long dead, so too are they shaped by punishments which are little more than paranoid fears. Many academics and professionals believe that for the sake of their careers they must exercise the utmost discretion in what they put online, and they confidently tell young people to exercise the same discretion for the sake of their own futures. But the reality is almost the exact opposite. First of all, with some important exceptions of course, nobody gives a shit about what you put on the internet. Nobody with any power over you has the time to follow, and the few that do won’t care enough about you to follow or dig very much. In my now slightly above-average history of recklessly posting to the internet, before and after getting a competitive professional job, the worst that has ever happened is that nobody cares (and that’s most of the time). But the best that has happened, here and there, is that a lot of people care and appreciate it and new friends are made and all kinds of new paths appear, individually and collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-restraining, strategic professional intellectual is not only operating on incorrect beliefs but beliefs which are almost exactly inverse to the truth: today, playing by rules of respectability is perhaps the straightest path to unemployment and impotent resentment, while simply &lt;em&gt;cultivating the capacity to say or do something real&lt;/em&gt; (by definition prohibited by respectability), is a necessary (and sometimes even sufficient) condition for being genuinely valued by anyone, anywhere. Obviously if you have certain dimensions of poor character (i.e. you’re a racist or something) then reckless posting to the internet will likely, and perhaps rightly, lead to many negative consequences. But if you’re a basically decent person who just wants to push a little harder on what you really think, what you really feel, your experiences or your interests, or even just fuck around, the conventional wisdom still drastically overestimates the punishments and underestimates the rewards of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these comments feel to you outdated because you think all of this already happened years ago with the initial rise of the internet, I would say you underestimate the quantity of human beings (and the qualitative intensities they could produce), who have yet to fully update their beliefs and behaviors around these matters. In some sense, the United States only just now, in 2016, elected its first President of the internet age. The fact that millions of people are genuinely perplexed and horrified by what is happening in this regard, is an index of how little the internet’s rewiring of power circuits has actually been integrated in the perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors of most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If political theory will ever be a world-historical causal factor in the radically fragmented and decentralized age of information, I believe it will at least partially have to consist in living, interpersonal transmissions of &lt;em&gt;what works&lt;/em&gt; to produce power within concrete, available situations. I suppose it is on that belief that I am reflecting on matters such as the micro-politics of self-expression, with some personal context as anecdotal data. I believe there exist objective, micro-political mechanisms whereby &lt;em&gt;being real&lt;/em&gt; generates &lt;em&gt;real power&lt;/em&gt;; that many people under-estimate or mistrust the objective reality of this mechanism; that many people live under compliant resentment because of incorrect beliefs about how the macro-social institutional environment will respond to their idiosyncratic deviations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I speak about myself at all, it’s not because I’m special or great but precisely because I am nothing, nobody, yet it has always been in learning how to become nobody that I seem to unlock whatever few real powers now possess me. I’m a young nobody academic or writer or whatever, I’m not famous or influential in academia or even on the internet, but I have been able to cultivate and maintain an energetic, autonomous, creative intellectual life that feels to me on the right track intellectually and politically, by what I think is a more accurate but still uncommon map of our immediate strategic environment, combined with periodically forcing myself to push outward on what feels to be in some way not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have almost come to see this as a methodological principle—wherever you genuinely think or observe or desire to do something that you would be vaguely punished socially for saying/doing at a dinner party, then saying/doing that on the internet almost always produces immanent power and its by-product joy; it almost always clears debilitating noise and advances one of the threads that make-up the continiuty of one’s life. The entire life orientation that believes facing toward power is the image of intellectual and political sophistication—this, in my view, is the spitting image of mystified contemporary complicity. If I am trying to share how I think all of this works, and how I have experienced it, it is because I dream of what would happen if thousands of highly capable intellects currently toiling under institutional respectability suddenly realized they have no reason to self-censor and everything to gain from simply disarming their objectively miscalibrated expression calculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-puzzle&#34;&gt;The Puzzle&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a widespread consensus in the economics literature that the rise of information technology over the past several decades has been a “skill-biased technological change.” A skill-biased technological change increases the productivity of skilled workers more than it improves the productivity of unskilled workers, therefore increasing the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. This increased demand for skilled workers, ceteris paribus, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000493&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;increases their income relative to unskilled workers&lt;/a&gt;. It is widely agreed that this is a key explanation for at least some of the rapid increase in income inequality since the 1980s.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One key observation consistent with this theory is that it is only after the appearance of micro-computers that income inequality begins to rise in the early 1980s.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A second key observation is that more educated workers are more likely to use a computer on the job&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this growing interest in the economic implications of technological change, social scientists have failed to take seriously a surprisingly similar line of thought advanced most notably in twentieth-century German philosophy. Heidegger and, later, the Frankfurt School theorists developed critical theories of technology which argued, in different ways, that technological changes shape ethical attitudes toward the world. In particular, a specific line of thought revolves around the relationship between technological development and instrumental rationality, or in other words formal analytical rationality which renounces consideration of substantive goals and concerns itself only with calculating the optimal means toward given ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Heidegger, from a phenomenological perspective, technology represents a &amp;ldquo;clearing&amp;rdquo; of Being which generates a relation to the world in which nature and other humans are merely &amp;ldquo;standing-reserve&amp;rdquo; waiting to be exploited as means to whatever ends. For Adorno, Horkheimer, and especially Marcuse, modern technological advancements were &amp;ldquo;organizing and perpetuating (or changing) social relationships, a manifestation of prevalent thought and behavior patterns, an instrument for control and domination.”&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While positivist social scientists have long perceived these types of claims from continential social theory to be hopelessly speculative and empirically intractable, this is puzzling given that the core claim emerging from this particular current in the critical theory of technology is relatively straightforward: technological development increases the prevalence of instrumentalism among other possible ethical attitudes toward the world. Moreover, the theory of skill-biased technological change is a powerful heuristic for modeling this argument given that it is a well-established model of how technology can generate unequal distributions of power without any reference to Marxian bugaboos which have likely caused more confusion than clarity by now.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is perhaps more fair to observe that critical theorists indeed sometimes lack what contemporary social scientists would call “mechanisms,&amp;rdquo; or specifiable and testable triggers which effectively do the work of some variable &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; supposedly causing some variable &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;. While this particular critique of technological development is not delivered with any particular &amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; which would be intelligible to many empirical social scientists working today, critical theory does supply many useful hints in this direction. Moreover, the basic argument is surprisingly consistent with well-known economic models, however disparate might be the vocabularies, thus permitting the elaboration of a critical theory of technological change empirically testable and consistent with a rational-choice framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-theory&#34;&gt;A Theory&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better specify the mechanism whereby technological change may plausibly generate a greater prevalence of instrumental ethics, I propose a theory of &lt;em&gt;ethically-biased&lt;/em&gt; technological change. I argue that certain technological changes can increase the income paid to certain ethical orientations relative to others. As in the theory of skill-biased technological change, certain technological changes increase the productivity of certain ethical orientations relative to others, increasing their relative demand, and therefore increasing their relative income. This increase in relative income represents a premium paid to those with the ethical resources required by the new technology, just as skill-biased technological change generates a premium paid to those with the technical resources required by the new technology.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, a technological change which increases productivity but transgresses &lt;em&gt;any particular ethical value&lt;/em&gt; will increase the productivity of individuals with the weakest commitment to that ethical value relative to those more firmly committed to that ethical value, thus increasing demand for them relative to the more ethical individuals, and thereby increasing their relative income. Ethically transgressive technological innovations increase the productivity of the least ethical because ethical compunctions are effectively a psychological tax on a worker. It is hard to take a job, and then demoralizing to work it, to the degree one feels ethical compunction for doing so. While an employer would have to pay very high wages to attract highly ethical workers to an ethically transgressive job, the wages they have to pay to attract relatively unethical workers will tend to be lower. The firmer one&amp;rsquo;s ethical commitment, the greater is the tax one pays to work an ethically transgressive job, the less worthwhile the wage, and the less likely is one to take the job; the weaker one&amp;rsquo;s ethical commitment, the lower is the tax, the more worthwhile is the wage, and the more likely one is to take the job. The overall implication is that technological change rewards individuals with weak ethical convictions relative to individuals with strong ethical convictions, and therefore exerts a direct, material pressure on the evolution of ethics within society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three key, testable implications we would expect to observe if this model indeed captures important aspects of the historical record. First, during times of ethically transgressive technological innovation, the first workers will be individuals who before the technological innovation were already less ethically scrupulous on the relevant ethical dimension. Second, workers of the new technology will be paid a premium which would be, in principle, distinct from any skill premium, although of course these can be correlated. Third, if we add the assumption of modern capitalist institutions, wherein wage workers have no common land and no immediate means of production, then the price of integrity for committedly ethical individuals literally becomes death. This last implication means that, if technological change is ethically biased as I hypothesize, the steady-state to which it must tend in the long-run is the absolute evacuation of integrity from all participants in the labor market. Note that this can come about through two different causal pathways: ethical individuals can learn to sacrifice their integrity to compete with the unethical and survive, &lt;em&gt;and/or&lt;/em&gt; ethical individuals can literally die off while unethical individuals thrive and replace them (evolutionary change). It should be noted explicitly that while observations 1 and 2 show how ethically-biased technological change reward certain ethical orientations differently and unequally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, a general acquaintenace with the contours of modern history seems to suggest some striking evidence for this model of ethically-biased technology change. Consider, for instance, that while a certain amount of philosophical liberalism was no doubt necessary for the industrial revolution to emerge, and this perhaps explains why it began in England, it seems equally undeniable that the industrial revolution in turn &lt;em&gt;generated&lt;/em&gt; an extraordinary instrumental turn and valorization of self-interest wherever it went. It will obviously require more work to test this expectation more rigorously, but it seems highly probable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, building from insights of the Frankfurt School, I provide a specific, empirically testable mechanism which accounts for the large-scale historical variations in ethical outlook they described to the dismissal of the mainstream social scientists of the time. Working heuristically from rational-choice economic theory, my stylized theoretical model is consistent with but more general than the rational-choice framework because the model here in some sense explains what rational-choice models merely assume (the prevalance of instrumentally rational dispositions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If correct, the long-run, world-historical implication of this model could not be more staggering for understanding the ethical experience of living through modern, let alone contemporary, capitalism: if this model is correct, then it would mean that today we have inherited a world in which ethical integrity has been subjected to a roughly 300-500 year forced evacuation by labor market institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;I have in mind such perennial bad habits as lazily but self-certainly referring to Capital as a conspiratorial agent, an argument which has never boded very well for Marxism.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;Indeed, the analogy between skill-biased and ethically-biased technological change is all the more apt if we, with Foucault, conceptualize the practice of ethos as itself a kind of technical game; if ethical resources are themselves understood as technologies of the self. Key examples in this context are those most bourgeois of ethical resources: the various techniques of repressing ethical compunctions and moral anxieties, and the various techniques of guilt management consequently required by this ethos. In this register, ethically-biased technological change would be essentially identical to skill-biased technological with the exception that the &amp;ldquo;skills&amp;rdquo; in question are the skills of self-management rather than economic production. The reason we must avoid this reductionism at the outset is that it would beg the most important question, namely, the question regarding &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; exactly did the contemporary human become, quite peculiar in the long-run of world history, so instrumentalist that the only activities remaining in contemporary life are exploiting and suffering exploitation?
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

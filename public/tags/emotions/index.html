    <h2><a href="/post/a-note-on-masculinity-and-self-expression/">A note on masculinity and self-expression</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      One characteristically masculine technique of expression is to translate feelings of fear and insecurity into verbal and gestural forms of aggression and bids for power. In other words: not expression at all, but rather the opaque, instrumental action of concretely attempting to remove an irritation by subduing its real or imagined sources. Not depleting or reducing fear and insecurity but simply displacing them onto others. What the average man expects from women, and indeed requires from them, in order to exist with the fears and insecurities he knows no other way to deal with, is the woman&rsquo;s passive compliance with this masculinist formula of translating felt fears and insecurities into aggression, and many popular tropes about male-female romance only catalog the most traditional and well-known ways in which women have figured out how to cope with these strategic ruses of masculine dissimulation which are intended to pass for expression.

    <h2><a href="/post/a-thought-on-jealousy/">A thought on jealousy</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When one person is jealous of another, that jealousy can be oppressive for the other, of course, but it can also be perversely comforting: Jealousy is flattering. And in the most dangerous cases, rather than balance each other, the oppressiveness and the comfort fuel each other. If the oppression of jealousy is intolerable and even debilitating, the comfort that is supplied by its flattering component can begin to feel all the more needed.

    <h2><a href="/post/2016-12-20-bigoted-family-members/">How to deal with nasty family members during the holidays? Relax and have fun with them</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Leftists love to discuss the dilemma of &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo; family members. There is this kind of tradition in left-wing circles, to discuss, around the holiday season, how to &ldquo;deal&rdquo; with those family members who think or say things out of line with educated progressive morality.
This is a great example of how left-wing individuals elevate their own anxiety and insecurity into an ethical value. This recurring conversation about bigoted family members is really dumb, for a few reasons.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/resentment-and-vegetarianism/">Resentment and vegetarianism</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      People only eat meat because their repressed rage makes them bloodthirsty. All forms of bloodthirst are driven by resentment and revenge; this is the only conceivable reason why smart and good-natured people insist on eating meat. Everyone is so oppressed by social institutions but unable to kill any of the humans responsible for those institutions, that the half-hearted laments of unapologetic animal-eaters often reduce to: “I must reserve at least this one right to exercise my insatiable need to take life for myself.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2013-01-05-sensitivity-a-scarce-resource/">Sensitivity is a scarce resource</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Most people are sensitive in their relations with loved ones but insensitive to the far greater suffering of others. This is disastrous for the loved ones as well as humanity in general. The real challenge for loved ones must be to treat each other with loving insensitivity, a mutual respect so deep that it is impossible to silently indulge the other’s flaws and weaknesses. This is not only a truer and more mutually empowering path for the loved ones, but perhaps even more importantly, it reserves one’s limited resources of sensitivity for maintaining the highest possible degree of awareness and protest toward the rest of the world’s deepest and most urgent varieties of human suffering.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2017-02-02-politics-of-not-knowing/">Social science and the radical politics of not knowing</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The amount of bullshit circulating at the moment is astounding. And to be clear, it appears to be just as bad in left-wing circles. In fact, what I see happening on the left is the most troubling to me because that’s where I’m positioned. There’s this idea you should “punch up” or focus one’s criticisms on one’s “enemies” but I think that’s a fatally mistaken notion. If you and your friends are thinking or doing something incorrectly, that is the most urgent issue.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2017-06-20-the-affective-politics-of-keeping-it-real/">The affective politics of keeping it real</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It once made sense for professional intellectuals to bite their tongue in exchange for the influence they could gain by conforming to the dominant language. For a while, this was arguably rational and defensible—perhaps even a game-theoretic necessity for anyone sincerely interested in cultivating a genuinely public and political intellectual project. While it’s obvious the internet has changed the game, old stereotypes die hard and continue to constrain human potential well after their objective basis has disappeared.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/2013-08-31-the-hatred-of-freedom/">The hatred of freedom</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The truth is that most people do not want other people to flourish. We all support a general idea of everyone being freer but we tend to feel threatened whenever anyone in particular meets with an increase of freedom. Not long after, we begin to hate them for it if we are not welcome or able to enjoy in the proceeds.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/the-radical-core-of-conservatism/">The radical core of conservatism</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Nobody wants to feel as if there is a &ldquo;big Other&rdquo; against which one has to defend oneself. Most people do generally want to learn about new ideas and the perspectives and experiences of others; I even think many people would be generally open to hearing marginalized voices and trying to understand how oppression works, but nobody wants to learn about new and strange ideas if they see those ideas as a pre-written doctrine which they&rsquo;re simply being told to accept.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/the-vertigo-of-social-mobility/">The vertigo of social mobility</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Institutions lure you by flattering you, in a world where it is nearly impossible to find recognition outside of them; you begin to see yourself only in institutions that pre-exist you and over which you exercise no influence. If this is perfectly internalized, then you get typical neuroses, mid-life crises, etc. Alternatively, if it&rsquo;s not perfectly internalized, then you get perpetual, mini crises up front; you perpetually realize you&rsquo;re over-worked and over-working on things that are somehow sterilized in advance so as to make sure you cannot exercise freedom over them and you also realize that no matter how hard you work you will not overcome this impotence.

abstract: 'In Plato’s Republic, Polemarchus says he will not listen and his interlocutors “better make up [their] mind to that." Drawing on ancient Greek religion, Lacan, Deleuze, and Foucault, I show the Republic to be a topological solution to the problem that philosophical theory relies on political forces.'

abstract: 'Scholars debate whether the arrival of articial super intelligence — a form of intelligence that significantly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in most domains — would bring positive or negative consequences. I argue that a third possibility is plausible yet generally overlooked: for several different reasons, an articial superintelligence might choose to exert no appreciable effect on the status quo ante (the already existing collective superintelligence of commercial cyberspace). Building on scattered insights from web science, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, I elaborate and defend this argument in the context of current debates about the future of articial intelligence.'

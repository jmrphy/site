All the old content should still be here, with the same URLs. The Jekyll site was cool, but too liable to unexpected Ruby snags that I'm not competent enough to fix rapidly. The other major reason for switching to Hugo is to leverage the *blogdown* workflow within Rstudio, and the smooth github-netlify publishing flow.

<p>Balaji Srinivasan put out <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280261091302375424">a call</a> for “the best diversity report on tech journalists,” building on some initial data collected by <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian">OoTheNigerian</a>. Here’s my stab at it.</p>
<p>This is a first cut, not a final statement on what is a rather thorny social-scientific question. There will very likely be some errors in the datasets. If you spot any, <a href="https://theotherlifenow.com/contact/">please contact me.</a></p>
<div id="background-and-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Background and overview</h2>
<p>The initial dataset gathered by <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian">OoTheNigerian</a> focused on the diversity of attendees at tech-journalism conferences, but this approach has two major limitations. First, conferences are subject to a variety of selection biases, which might not have anything to do with tech-journalism culture per se. Second, there are only so many tech-journalism conferences, so this approach will likely leave us with an unnecessarily small sample.</p>
<p>Here I pursue a different strategy. I first collect lists of tech journalists on Twitter. Then I leverage data from the Census and the Social Security Administration to infer each journalist’s race and gender. The resulting dataset allows us to estimate racial and gender diversity in tech journalism.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-on-sampling-method" class="section level2">
<h2>Note on sampling method</h2>
<p>While my approach certainly has its own limitations, analyzing the culture of tech journalism via Twitter-based samples seems uniquely attractive. First, it’s possible some tech journalists are not on Twitter, but since Twitter is both a hot technology and a watering-hole for journalists, this potential selection bias seems particularly unthreatening. Twitter is arguably the ideal place to draw a sample of tech journalists. A second limitation of my approach is that I may very well fail to identify some tech journalists who are on Twitter, but this is only an analytical problem if there is some reason to believe that white people or male people are more or less likely to surface in my search procedures. Assuming this is very unlikely, the worst that can be said of my sampling method is that it’s unlikely to capture every single tech journalist on Twitter. Nonetheless, it is likely to be quite close to a random sample of all the tech journalists on Twitter, which means it should plausibly generalize.</p>
<p>As a robustness check, I conduct the analyses on two different samples collected using two different Twitter-based sampling methods. In a first cut, I collect a sample of tech journalists by searching Twitter bios. In a second cut, I collect a sample from public lists of “Tech Journalists” curated by third parties. The results are nearly identical, suggesting the analyses below very likely reflect the underlying state of tech journalism, at least on Twitter. If I’m right that most tech journalists are on Twitter, then the analyses should generally reflect tech journalism as such. If there is a non-trivial community of tech journalists not on Twitter someone should tell them about what’s new in the world of technology.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problems-with-inferring-race-and-gender-from-names" class="section level2">
<h2>The problems with inferring race and gender from names</h2>
<p>The approach pursued here seems to be the approach with the best balance of objectivity, scalability, and efficiency, but all research methods face serious limitations. In this case, perhaps the biggest problem is due to the history of anti-black racism and slavery in the United States. Because of slavery in the United States, black people in America today frequently have non-African last names (such as Williams or Washington). Therefore, inferring race from surnames will generally under-count black people. As you’ll see below, I take some extra steps to mitigate this problem (see my comments inside the code snippets), but the results of any automated measurement method will always have some amount of error. The only alternatives would be to use subjective judgment to infer race from pictures (which seems even more fraught and potentially insensitive than the approach I’ve taken) or to solicit racial self-identifications from tech journalists (which similarly seems more fraught and potentially insensitive than the approach I’ve taken). Ultimately the best solution to the limitations of my method is to suggest that errors can be reported to me personally and I’ll either correct the dataset or, in the case of uncertainty, remove the uncertain entry in the dataset. Same for gender.</p>
</div>
<div id="approach-1-tech-journalists-who-mention-a-major-tech-journalism-outlet-in-their-bio" class="section level2">
<h2>Approach 1: Tech journalists who mention a major tech-journalism outlet in their bio</h2>
<p>I used the R package <em>rtweet</em> to search for anyone on Twitter who mentions one of the following tech-journalism oulets in their bio: TechCrunch, ReCode, The Information, or The Verge. The API allows for up to 1,000 results per search, but in every case the number of results was less than 1,000.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load required packages 

require(rtweet)
require(tidyverse)
require(predictrace)
require(stringr)
require(gender)
require(DT)

# Search for accounts mentioning tech-journalism outlets 

tc &lt;- search_users(&quot;@TechCrunch&quot;, n = 1000)
tc$outlet&lt;-&quot;TechCrunch&quot;

rc &lt;- search_users(&quot;@ReCode&quot;, n = 1000)
rc$outlet&lt;-&quot;ReCode&quot;

ti &lt;- search_users(&quot;@TheInformation&quot;, n = 1000)
ti$outlet&lt;-&quot;TheInformation&quot;

tv &lt;- search_users(&quot;@Verge&quot;, n = 1000)
tv$outlet&lt;-&quot;TheVerge&quot;

# Bind search results into one dataframe
journos&lt;-rbind(tc, rc, ti, tv)

# Restrict to English language accounts
journos &lt;- journos %&gt;%
  filter(lang==&quot;en&quot;) %&gt;%
  select(screen_name, name, location, description, followers_count, friends_count,
         listed_count,  statuses_count, favourites_count,   account_created_at, verified,
         profile_expanded_url,  outlet) %&gt;%
  drop_na(name)

# Standardize and export for manual inspection
journos &lt;- apply(journos,2,as.character)
write.csv(journos, &quot;journos.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The total number of accounts identified in this fashion was 1879, but most of them were false positives (the API does not seem to recognize the @ symbol). So I manually went through the results and narrowed the dataset down to individuals who included the outlet’s main Twitter handle in their personal bio. Typically the profile says something like “currently at X” or “formerly at X.” I also standardized names and removed emojis in preparation for the next stage of analysis. This process left 273 individuals. After removing duplicates (due to people writing for multiple outlets), the full sample for Sample 1 was 252 individuals.</p>
<p>Next we leverage the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/predictrace/vignettes/Predict-race-of-surname.html"><em>predictrace</em></a> package to infer race from surnames, based on the co-occurrence of surnames and self-reported races in the Census datasets.</p>
<p>And then we leverage the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gender/vignettes/predicting-gender.html"><em>gender</em></a> package to infer gender from first names, based on the co-occurrence of baby names and gender in the Social Security Administration datasets.</p>

<h2>Approach 2: Curated lists of “tech journalists”</h2>
<p>I found two Twitter lists entitled “Tech Journalists” (<a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/96162061">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/53301954">2</a>). I take these at face value and combine all the listed Twitter accounts into a new sample of tech journalists. Then I re-run all of the analyses above on this new sample. The initial number of journalists in Sample 2 is 424; after removing duplicates the number is 360.</p>
<p>The basic counts are: 165 likely to be white, 17 likely to be Asian, 23 likely to be black, and 8 likely to be Hispanic.</p>
